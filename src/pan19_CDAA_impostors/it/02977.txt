How Big How Blue How Beautiful
 
Set our hearts ablaze, and every city was a gift
And every skyline was like a kiss upon the lips
And I was making you a wish
And every skyline

How big, how blue, how beautiful
How big, how blue, how beautiful

And meanwhile a man was falling from space
And every day I wore your face
Like an atmosphere around me
A satellite beside me
And meanwhile a man was falling from space
As he hit the earth I left this place
Let the atmosphere surround me
A satellite beside me

What are we gonna do?
We've opened the door, now it's all coming through
Tell me you see it too
We've opened our eyes and its changing the view
Oh, what are we gonna do?
We've opened the door, now its all coming through

How big, how blue, how beautiful
How big, how blue, how beautiful

And every city was a gift
And every skyline was like a kiss upon the lips
And I was making you a wish
And every skyline
