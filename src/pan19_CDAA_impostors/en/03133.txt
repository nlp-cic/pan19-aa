Killian looked like he was poking around among what appeared to be board games by the end of the bar. He grabbed something and tucked it under his arm before he returned to the table with their beer.

“Here we go, Swan,” he placed her beer in front of her while settling into his seat. “While we wait for our food, care for a spot of Jenga?”

Emma pulled the box towards her after a quick sip of beer. Upending the game, she slid the box up preserving the tower of game pieces. “Who knew drunks were so considerate?”

“Bloody hell, I don’t even do that.” His fingers reached out to snag a bar napkin that fluttered out from the bottom of the box. “Who puts it away so neatly?”

Emma snorted “Somehow I’m not surprised”

She carefully made sure the jenga tower was in the center of the table; not too close to their respective drinks.

“I wonder why there are dots on the pieces?” Emma turned one over looking at the marks before placing it back atop the tower.

They proceeded to trade turns pushing the pieces from below and stacking them on top while waiting on their meals. Emma couldn’t help but chuckle to herself at the look of intense concentration on Killian’s face. He must not have realized he was sticking his tongue out while he tried to find the most stable block to move.

 Damn, I shouldn’t be finding that cute. He   IS   growing on me. What the hell is wrong with me? 

The waitress finally arrived and scowled down at the tower of blocks obstructing her spot to put their food. Emma glanced up and smiled sheepishly before carefully sliding the game out of the way.

“Sorry,” she mumbled to the waitress while she took another swig of beer. Killian raised his beer and chugged down the rest of his. She was more than ready to dive into her food.

Once the basket of fries and onions rings where between them, all conversation ended and they concentrated on their meal. The grilled cheese was crispy and Emma wasn’t sure she’d tasted anything so good since they’d started this jaunt across the country. Killian’s burger looked just as delicious and he groaned in a way that had her shifting in her seat.


 That’s a pretty sinful sound. 


As he munched on a french fry, Killian pulled the bar napkin that had fallen out of the jenga box toward him. A smile spread across his face and he handed it across to Emma.

“Appears those marks on the blocks are for a reason Swan.”

She read the basic rules that someone had jotted down. “Drunken Jenga?”

“Are you up for the challenge?”

“Sure, it’s not like there’s anything else going on in this place,” she glanced at the scruffy looking trucker who had taken up residence at the end of the bar. He looked to be humming along to the holiday tunes drifting out of a beat up speaker over his head. “Not sure I could handle karaoke with the locals.”

“Was that a joke?” he stood up. “Be careful there Swan, you may have to admit to having fun with me.”

Killian made his way back to the bar and returned with a pitcher of beer and two shot glasses cradled in one of his hands.

“Prepare to have your ass kicked,” he smirked at her. “Since a star on the piece means a shot, I took the liberty of getting whiskey.”

Emma arched an eyebrow at the drink of choice.

 I am partial to Jameson’s .

“That’s a star on my piece,” Killian gleefully waved it towards Emma’s face. “That’s a shot according to the rules.” He swayed into her space, the effects of the alcohol making him want to push her buttons; he may or may not admit to himself that her hair smelled good too.

“Yeah yeah, I’m drinking,” Emma shoved him back and grabbed her shot glass to drain it. “My turn Jones.”

He watched as she squinted at the pile of interlocking blocks. They’d been playing long enough that they’d refilled the pitcher and the tower was beginning to teeter precariously. He was really enjoying the teasing between them. After a few drinks Emma’s walls were most certainly lowered.

“Careful there Swan, don’t want to knock the whole thing down, otherwise you’ll be finishing  all the drinks.”

“You’re just trying to distract me.”

“I can think of much better ways to distract you than pestering you, love.”


 Shit, did I just say that out loud? 


He held his breath and glanced up to see if she would retreat behind her walls at his blatant innuendo. She rested her elbows on the table and lifted her head from her perusal of the jenga pieces. He expected to see anger or fear, but was surprised to see a flash of...is that desire?

She snorted, “Oh? Just what sort of distractions did you have in mind?” She poked a piece and
