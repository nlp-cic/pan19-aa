how the meteorite looked, make sure no new wrigglers appeared, the works.

Outside, he was surprised to find a ditch in front of his door, instead of the hole he was expecting. Looking down to where whatever it was had stopped, he saw a giant metal ball. Approaching it, he jumped as one side opened, spewing dust and gas. As he peered inside, there was only a small red light illuminating one side. There was a click, and just as he was about to look closer, a large shape jumped out and tackled him.

"Karkat!" A familiar voice exclaimed. But it couldn't be...

"Egbert?! What the hell are you doing here?!" he asked more out of anger than shock.

"Aw, aren't you happy to see me?" John asked, standing up.

"No! You don't have the right to ask questions! I'm asking questions here!" the troll demanded. "Now, why the hell are you here?"

"Because I can be!" he smiled through his usual buck teeth. "And I don't think Earth is a good place to be anymore. The Reckoning wiped it out..."

"Okay, so are the other pink freaks with you?" Karkat continued.

"Well, kind of," John said nervously. "I wonder how they are..."

"Don't get off topic! What do you mean by kind of?!"

"They should be on Alternia, but they're at other hives. I know Dave's with Terezi, and Rose is with Kanaya... Jade said something about a legendary gun... Is it breezy here?"

"No, your just an idiot wearing clothes that are too small!" Karkat retorted. John looked down at himself, realizing that his shirt and shorts had gotten much too small. He felt rather awkward.

"Wow! How long did I sleep for?" he peered back inside the pod, looking at the red light. "Woah..."

"Woah what?!" the troll demanded, trying to see around the human.

"I slept in this thing for four years straight!"

"Translation?"

"Um, I slept since we left the game. I think its most of two sweeps for you guys?"

"Yeah, that's how long it's been since we left, shit sponge!" Karkat huffed irritatedly.

"Hey, do you think we could check on the others?" John asked.

"Fine. Come inside."

"Yay! Thanks Karkitty!" John was decked faster than he could say "ectobiology".

Dave stood just outside his pod, feeling rather awkward in his obviously too small clothes. Apparently it was possible to go through growth spurts while you slept for four years. In front of him was a giant, old fashion scale. One side held what looked a broken egg. Suddenly, he heard a crunching sound behind him.

"Dave?" came a familiar voice. He turned to see the female troll.

"Hey." Terezi ran over to him, and directly proceeded to lick his face. "Okay, that is still gross." She laughed.

"It's really you! What brings you to Alternia?" she asked, giving her pointy toothed grin.

"Besides this messed up space ship? The fact that most of Earth is currently a wasteland and probably not exactly the ideal home for us anymore."

"Oh," was all she could say. "So the others came with you then?" The blind troll didn't smell anybody else around them.

"Yeah, but they're at other homes. Bee hives. Whatever you call them. I'm pretty sure Rose is with Kanaya, but I have no clue where Jade is, and John is either at Karkat's or Vriska's."

"He's are Karkat's," she replied simply. Her glasses projected the message she had just received into the air in front of her. Dave stood next to her and read the chat so far.
