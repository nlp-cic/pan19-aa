! fever died down, but I do hope there are still some fans out there who, like me, are always on the lookout for SeiGou fics. Lmao.

The day of the joint training finally arrived and Gou was a nervous wreck. Other than a vague “Leave everything to us!”, Gou had no clue on what to expect from their proffered assistance.

Right on time, the Samezuka swim team piled in donning their signature jackets while carrying matching duffel bags. The sheer number of them would have made them seem intimidating had it not been for their cheerful banter and excited faces. Rounding up the herd were three familiar faces, one of which caused Gou to blush tenfold. 

A reassuring pat on her shoulder from Makoto was just what she needed to bring her back down to earth and he gestured over to where Seijuurou stood looking around for something—or rather, someone. With a deep breath, Gou followed Makoto to greet the other team’s captain, as well as her dear brother.

As soon as pleasantries were exchanged, however, Makoto immediately herded Rin away, making sure to be inconspicuous as he did so. Fortunately, the older Matsuoka followed along without suspecting a thing; unfortunately, the same could be said for his younger sister.

Unbeknownst to Gou, the Iwatobi team’s plan to give her an opening to talk to Seijuurou had commenced at that point but so engrossed was she in going over the activities of the day with the captain that before she could even think about confessing, Rin was calling out to Seijuurou to talk about something.

“I’ll talk to you more later,” Seijuurou promised with a grin that was obviously flirtatious to everyone but Gou. When he was out of earshot, Rei began reprimanding Gou for letting their effort to distract Rin go to waste though she argued that she was not even aware that such an opportunity had arisen—she was the team’s manager, after all, and she had her duties, too.

Unable to argue with her logic, Rei merely went back to training while hoping that the others’ plans would work. Needless to say, their first attempt at getting Gou to talk to Seijuurou was a failure.

For their second try, Makoto took the lead and asked Gou to retrieve something from the storeroom. And since Seijuurou was conveniently standing right next to her (in reality, he was being a dork and was trying to get close to her as much as he could), the Iwatobi captain requested that he accompany her since the item might be too heavy for her to carry.

This time, Gou was aware that a plan was underway. From the corner of her eye, she spotted the Iwatobi team distracting Rin as she and Seijuurou started making their way to the storeroom.

Silence plagued their journey as the two were filled with nervousness, more so with Gou as she played out how she planned on confessing in her head.

When they finally reached their destination, however, and before Gou could even open her mouth to initiate a conversation, Seijuurou went about looking under every nook and cranny in a very robotic manner, not realizing he didn’t even know what he was looking for.

Flushing with embarrassment at how he wouldn’t even look her in the eye and suddenly having lost all the courage she had been building up, Gou merely gave a sigh of defeat and dejectedly told him that whatever item they were looking for wasn’t there and went back to the pool area with her head and spirits down, much to the Iwatobi boys’ chagrin.

“So, what’s your next plan?” Gou asked Nagisa dubiously. She eventually realized that the four boys were taking turns initiating their own plans and doubted whether anyone else’s would work after the previous attempt which happened to be Makoto’s idea; she figured that if Makoto couldn’t do it, no one else probably could.


Not that she was giving up. She was just… concerned for her well-being since it was Nagisa’s turn now.

All of a sudden, Nagisa started laughing really loudly and proceeded to slap her arm, too.

“Ouch! What’re you doing?! That hurts!”

“Oh, Gou-chan, you’re so funny! Ha! Ha! Ha!” Then, as he saw the perfect timing, Nagisa pushed Gou backwards into the muscular arms of the Mikoshiba who just happened to be standing right behind her.

Thankfully, he caught her before she could topple backwards but when she looked up and saw how close his face was to hers, she got flustered and, unfortunately, passed out.

Rin ran right over to help her out and she soon regained consciousness but by this time, the moment was already gone and she couldn’t muster up the courage to say anything other than a meek ‘thank you’ to her concerned savior.

This time was Haru’s turn and Gou was really curious as to what he had in store— that is, if he had planned for anything at all.

Gou was standing over by the pool in deep contemplation, preoccupied by speculations of what would happen
