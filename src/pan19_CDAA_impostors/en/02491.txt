I've been doing all that I can





 To hold it all together piece by piece.





 I've been feeling like a failure,





 Trying to be braver than I could ever be,





 It's just not me.




 Anno...my name is Yugi Mouto. I'm 14 years old. I live with my Jii-chan in a game shop called the Kame Game Shop. I don't see my parents, they're gone, as they should be. I have, to date, one friend, if you can even call her that. She comes and goes when she feels like it. Yeah, you can say she's not best friend material, but I can live with it. Not much for me to do about it anyways. To be blunt, my life sucks at the moment, but i hope I get my wish. 




So be my healer, 





Be my comfort,





Be my peace.





Cause i can be broken, 





I can be needy.




Lord i need you now to be... 



Oh! I didn't tell you about my puzzle, did I? Well, it's called the Sennen Puzzle, and I started it when I was about 7 years old. Jii-chan told me that I can make a wish on it, and that no one has solved it. I've been wishing for better friends. Ones who won't betray me, ones I won't betray. 



...I don't think my wish will come true...




Be my God, 





So I can just be me.
