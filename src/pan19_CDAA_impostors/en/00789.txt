…just let me go….I-I-I won’t say anything…please”

“But you are so fun to play with, why would I let you go” I can feel the truth behind his words and I start sobbing hard.

“Please…please…please”

“I will be back late with some food for you; if you are good I will even let you have a full glass of water”

As I hear him walk away, the echoing footsteps and the metal door bang; I can’t stop the tears from falling anymore, I know that the sick bastard is just playing with me, making me loss complete control over myself but what can I do 

As the foul stench of onion and whiskey start to leave the air around me, I decide to do the only thing that has kept me sane since I got here wherever here is I start to hum Moments, wishing I could be back with my boys.

“Louis…Louis…Lou, please turn around I need to change the gauze on your hand”Louis turns away from the window, giving Eleanor the same blank mask he has been wearing for the last three days. It takes a second for her to even recognize the love of her life. The louis Tomlinson that she fell in love with, the beautiful boy with the grey blue laughing eyes, has vanished and he has been replaced with a homunculus, a body with no soul, no emotions, and no life.Louis lifts up his bandaged hand, offering it to his girlfriend, his robotic moves are  are clearly making his girlfriend uncomfortable but he can’t help the stiffness in his body. He also really wants to thank her for staying with him since all of this happened, but he doesn’t care at the moment not when such an important part of himself is missing and possibly in danger....maybe even worse.“It’s looking better, still really swollen around the knuckles though” Eleanor lifts Louis’ hand to her lips and gives the heavily bruised knuckles a light kiss.“Hmmm” Is all that comes out of Louis, no reaction comes from the loving gesture Eleanor has just performed.Eleanor sighs and finishes wrapping up Louis’ injured hand and walks towards the kitchen “How about a cuppa?”The brunette turns to find that her boyfriend is once again standing by the huge panoramic window that gives a perfect view of the entrance of the apartment complex, just staring and waiting, waiting for someone to walk through the entrance of the complex.Eleanor is finding it hard to belief that this is the same boy she fell in love with. The boys like to make the comment all the time at interviews, that when the members of One Direction were not all together, they all felt a little weird, like they were missing a limb. Everyone thought it was a clever joke the boys made up to amuse people, and to help them excuse certain behavior they wanted to get away with. But Eleanor can clearly see that the comment was not meant as a joke at all, and she can plainly see it is starting to affect Louis, the Doncaster boy has been acting off the last three days, not to mention the episode he had a day ago, which resulted in his injured and swollen hand.Eleanor brings Louis a cup of his favorite Yorkshire tea, and sets it down on the table; the brunet barely acknowledges the cup.“Louis we need to go soon we have to meet Paul and the other boys soon”At the mention of Paul, Louis’ face turns in a murderous scowl and a growl comes out, a growl is that unnatural, Eleanor is startled when her boyfriend grabs the teacup on the table and flings it towards the wall; the resounding crash of porcelain against drywall can be hear all over the room, a deafening silence blankets the room following the crash.Eleanor can say that yes, Louis Tomlinson is a bit crazy, out of all of the members of One Direction, the Doncaster native is the most probable to act in a chaotic way. But this…this is not the controlled chaos Louis is known for. This Louis is completely different, as Eleanor turns him around so that they are facing each other, the normally mischievous grey blue eyes are not there, dark gray is the predomiant color almost no blue is visible. She can tell that he isn’t focusing on her at all, that he is trapped in his own head at the moment.“Louis…Louis…LOUIS”Louis jerks and starts gasping for air ‘El… I …EL….Please” When the shuttering and the shivering take over all of his body, Eleanor pulls him into her chest.As her boyfriend cries all the frustration, sadness, and darkness of the last three days, all Eleanor can do is hug Louis with all her strength and watch the last of the tea drip down the wall.
