him, looked as smug and turned on as he wanted him to.

- I’m gonna suck your cock, - Kyungsoo said while taking Chanyeol’s pants and underwear in one go. – I fucking love your cock, do you know that, Chanyeol-ah?

He gave it a few strokes, nuzzling at his balls and inhaling the heady scent of Chanyeol’s arousal that was making him crazy. Kyungsoo loved getting off on just how much he can shatter Chanyeol’s composure, just how much he can mess him up, just how undone could he make his boyfriend without doing much. Now it was a challenge, with the way Chanyeol got more comfortable, throwing one hand behind his head and looking all kinds of ‘Go ahead’, so Kyungsoo was going to put on a show for him.

He's licking the whole length up to the bulbous head, mouthing on it and playing with the slit before taking it all in one go, relaxing his throat around it and taking a moment to breathe. He can feel Chanyeol’s hand entwining in his hair, not pulling in any discomforting way, just holding him there until he starts to move. He’s looking at Chanyeol all the way while blowing him, breathing through his nose and letting Chanyeol’s cock thrust deeper in his mouth, moaning when he feels the whole length inside, just as Chanyeol likes it. He’s catching all the slightest gasps and tiny noises Chanyeol is making, looking up at him too see him eyes closed and head thrown back as he fucks Kyungsoo’s throat.

Kyungsoo takes great proud in having no apparent gag reflex, that allows him to take Chanyeol just the way he likes it, fucking into his throat until Kyungsoo gags. He lets the length out of his mouth, a trace of saliva on his lips and before he knows it Chanyeol is pulling him upwards to join their lips.
- As much as I’d love to come all over your pretty face, - he says when they break for air. – I really want to ride you.

- Can’t say no to that, - Kyungsoo says across his lips before coaxing them in another dirty kiss, moaning at the pleasure of Chanyeol’s cock sliding against his thigh.

Chanyeol rearranges them so that it’s Kyungsoo who’s lying on his back and straddles his thighs, bottle of lube already in his hands. He’s arranging himself in the position where Kyungsoo will get the best view, spreading his legs wide before reaching out to circle a lubed finger around his hole. He’s sensitive, always was, and riled up from Kyungsoo blowing him, but he likes to take this slow, drawing this out as much as he can. Kyungsoo’s hands are on his thighs, running up and down and squeezing firmly as he watches Chanyeol stretch himself.

He’s a beautiful sight like this. Toned muscles that he spent long time building, make his body even more impressive than before, Kyungsoo can see every muscle on his hand tense as he reaches out to play with his ass. But at the same time there is the familiar vulnerability of Chanyeol that was always there, Chanyeol getting lost in the wave of pleasure, holding on to Kyungsoo as if he’s the only thing that matters right now. Putting on a pretty show for Kyungsoo to enjoy – his boyfriend getting himself ready for Kyungsoo’s cock, pounding his fingers deep inside himself while watching Kyungsoo with hooded eyes and whispering his name like a prayer, asking for him nicely to fuck him.
Kyungsoo’s hand finds its way to his boyfriend’s ass, teasing his finger in alongside Chanyeol’s own and Chanyeol lets out a low guttural moan at being stretched like this. Kyungsoo doesn’t add much lube, making the stretch sting and it sends shivers down Chanyeol’s spine at the sensation of it being so raw, so intense, the sensation of being so close to coming like that, untouched, but forbidding himself to do so until Kyungsoo is sheeted deep inside him.

- Fuck, Kyungsoo, I need you right now, I don’t know for how long I can hold on, - Chanyeol’s voice is shaky and his movements hasty, looking for the bottle with lube and smearing a generous amount all over Kyungsoo’s cock. – Fuck, I want you to fuck me like that, I want to ride you raw, I want you to come inside me.

He’s guiding Kyungsoo’s cock inside of him and both of them forget how to breathe the moment he enters him. Kyungsoo is leaving soothing circles on Chanyeol’s thighs, while the latter clings to Kyungsoo’s shoulders for support.

He starts to move, slowly at first, running his hands all over Kyungsoo’s chest before picking up the pace. Chanyeol isn’t graceful by nature, no matter how many hours of dancing he went through, it never gave him the smoothness of movements or a better control of his long limbs, but for where he lacked in that he compensated with enthusiasm. It’s always enticing to
