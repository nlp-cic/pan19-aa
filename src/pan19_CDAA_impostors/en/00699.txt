body. 



'Aiden..' 



One last slash on his chest, blood oozing into a puddle. 



'Aiden!' 



The final blow. 



One slash across the neck. 



My eyes glance up, seeing my opponent for the first time.



 Eyes widen, fear crippling me. 



No... 



Ethan. 



'Aiden!' 



His lips barely move but I can hear him loud and clear. 



No, it can't be. 



I wouldn't.. 



'Aiden, dammit, wake up!' 


Â 

My eyes flash open, locking on Ethan as he sits at the side of my bed, shaking me awake.

"What the hell?! What happened?"

My eyes search the room, taking in everything as I left it.

No blood. No dying brother.


"You were having a nightmare. I could hear you growling from my room. What was it about?"


My eyes pin to his.

"What? Nothing. I don't remember.."

Lies. All lies.


"Oh. You sure-"


My eyes narrow slightly and he stops, knowing how much I hate when he questions me. I push him out of my way and get up. Sweat is dripping down my body and I take a deep breath as I start to pace the room, the dream still right there, haunting me.


"Aiden..."


"Don't, Ethan. I'm fine."


"You don't look fine. You look like shit."


I stop pacing to glare at my brother.

"Gee, thanks.."


"Tell me, Aiden."


"No."

Ethan was starting to get just as annoyed as me now. That was unusual.. I watch with a curious look as he sits on my bed.

"What? You heard something, didn't you?"


"Yeah... You kept mumbling about Deucalion and how it was your fault."


What? I don't remember that..

"You really think that, Aiden? Cause it wasn't-"

"Stop! Just stop, Ethan. We both know that's a lie."

Just like everything else. Just lies.

I turn away from Ethan and run my hands through my hair in frustration, my thoughts shifting back in time. They came at random, changing. Always changing so much. I can hear my mother's voice, faint yet crystal clear, her bright eyes sparkling in the light.


"Take care of him. Always take care of your brother, Aiden. No matter what. Don't let anyone hurt him."


"I will. No one will touch him. I promise."

Her face fades, my memory already losing details of her.

Again it shifts. Another face takes the place of hers. This one I don't like.


"You know what I don't like about you, mutt? You never learn."


"Neither do you. I said to leave my brother alone."

I hear a chuckle. I see his fist come right at my face, but I don't move.

Better me than Ethan.

Bones crack.

Pain shoots through my jaw.

Fuck, that hurt.

That's what happens when a werewolf twice your size knocks you down. I was use to it by now.

Another switch. Another face. Deucalion.

"You want to change it, boy? I can give you a better life, one you'll be proud of. One where you are strong. You want that, don't you?"

"Yes. Yes, I want that. More than you know."


"Oh, trust me, Aiden. I know. Just a few simple steps and you'll be stronger than them all."


I'm in an abandoned building now. Blood covers my hands. My eyes shine bright red in the dark. To match the blood, I think to myself. Ethan walks up beside me, his voice low and almost afraid.


"What have we done, Aiden?"


I don't look back at him. I know what I'll see. The same red eyes, tinged in guilt. Mine don't have that. They're just red.

Blood red.

"We did what we had to. We'll never be afraid again."

Never, right?

Wrong.

The last conversation Deucalion and I had flashes through my memory.

"You promised us a better life. You said we'd be free!"


"No. I said you'd be strong. I never said you'd be free."


Lies. Everything was lies.

Ethan's hand rests on my shoulder and I'm brought back to the present, past regrets filed away where they belong.


"Its not your fault.."


My eyes meet his, guilt now edging both sets. 'Yes, it is! I was supposed to protect you!' I want to scream this to him, but I can't.

"Go back to sleep, Ethan. I'm fine."


"Aid-"


"Go. Its a big day tomorrow."


"Yeah, first day at a new school. Just perfect."


I smile for him.
