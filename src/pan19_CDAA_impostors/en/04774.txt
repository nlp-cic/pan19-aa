to find a small note.	Dear Nick,Happy Easter! I’m sure you’re confused so let me explain. You probably noticed that I left work early yesterday. Well, that’s because I needed to set up a little surprise for you. I know that you didn’t want to come to Bunnyburrow for Easter, so I brought Bunnyburrow to you! Hidden around your apartment, Precinct One, and a few other places in Zootopia are Easter eggs. The greatest Easter egg hunt in the history of Easter! I guess we’ll see if you really can find all the eggs.	Love, Judy	Nick stared at the note in confusion. She left him a scavenger hunt before going home?! He looked at the egg again and saw that there was another, smaller piece of paper adhered to the bottom. He pried it out with his claws and unfolded it.	What one word has the most letters in it? (1/5)	Nick snorted in amusement. She only hid five eggs? How hard could it possibly be? Clearly, the next egg would be somewhere in the apartment. Nick inspected the piece of paper again. 	“The most letters…” He mused aloud, thinking about what were good hiding places. 	“The fridge!” He said suddenly, jumping out of bed and running into the other room. He whipped open his fridge and searched it top to bottom, but didn’t find a trace of an egg. Nick then spent the next hour of his life searching every nook and cranny of his apartment, from the television to the oven. Nick finally sat down at the dining room table in defeat. He looked absentmindedly at the mess he made looking for the egg and bent over to pick yesterdays’ mail off the floor. 	“Wait a minute.” He said, holding the mail, “The most letters… The mailbox!” Nick grabbed his robe and keys and rushed out of his apartment down to his mailbox. He shoved his key in the slot and ripped it open. Sitting there all by itself was one neon blue egg. Nick whooped in triumph and grabbed the egg, shut his mailbox, and returned to his apartment. He sat down at the table and pried the egg open, removing the clue from inside.	Not as easy as you thought, huh Slick? Here’s the next clue: What LUCKY mammal runs Precinct One? (2/5)	Nick looked at the clue again. She meant Bogo right? It couldn’t be anyone else. Who else had control over the officers? Nick shook his head and checked the clock. It was already noon. He grimaced and looked down at himself. He was still wearing his ratty pajamas and old robe. 	“Shower first. Scavenger hunt second.” Nick said firmly, then headed into the bathroom. He emerged 20 minutes later, got dressed and headed to the precinct.______________________________________________________________________________	Nick walked into the precinct and up to Bogo’s office, knocking on the doorframe as he walked in. Bogo quickly put his phone away and glared at the smirking fox. He needed to get a lock put on his door.	“Wilde you’re off duty today. What do you want?” 	“Did Judy happen to leave anything with you?” Nick asked, “Something egg-shaped perhaps?”	“Wilde don’t involve me in the games that you two play in your spare time. Get out.” Nick turned around and exited the office just as quickly as he’d entered. So much for that route. He walked down to the front desk and saw Clawhauser pouring himself a bowl of cereal.	“Hey Ben, how’s it going?” He asked. The chubby cheetah looked around for a moment before noticing the fox standing below his line of sight. 	“Hey Nick!” Ben replied while taking a bite of cereal, “Happy Easter!”	“Happy Easter to you too.” He said quickly “Listen, did Judy hide something in the precinct for me to find?” Clawhauser tapped the side of his nose and put his cereal down.	“I’m not supposed to tell you anything.” He said cheerfully, “Judy wants you to figure it out for yourself.” 	“Of course she does.” He sighed, “What’re you eating?” He asked, changing the subject.	“Lucky Chomps!” He responded while taking another bite, “Would you like some, it’s delicious!”	“No, I’m fine thanks—” Nick stopped as he remembered the one word in all caps on the clue, “Actually, could I see the box Ben?” Clawhauser nodded and handed Nick the cardboard box. Nick reached his arm all the way inside and felt around, finally smiling as he felt a smooth plastic object in his paw.	“Aha!” He said, pulling the neon yellow egg out, “Found it!”	“Nice job Nick!” Clawhauser said, “Judy said it would take you longer.”	“It almost did.” He said sheepishly, “I only got it because she put the word lucky in all caps on the clue.”	“Can I see it?” Clawhauser
