Two," he finalized, holding up another finger, "Whatever you might see on the scanners, ignore it. Forget it. You cannot say anything about what picks up." 

"Lance," Coran started, the disappointed uncle tone filtering into his tone, "what might I see?" 

Lance sighed. He had to tell someone, and Coran was agreeable at best. 

He shrugged and spread out his arms in a defeated, welcoming gesture. 

"You Alteans have magic, right?" Lance started. 

Coran nodded. "Yes, we do in fact practice magic. It's not just Haggar that has the gift, and our magic isn't always simple stuff like talking to Balmeras like what Allura did back on Balmera. We put magic in our macinery too, among other things." 

"Well, us humans have a bit of unexplained shit on our planet that we can only call magic, because it's not natural," Lance continued. "It's never beneficial to us, ever." 

Coran nodded. "Sounds quite unfortunate." 

"The day when Keith came back after Shiro and Allura got together. Did you hear mention of the Hanahaki Disease?" 

>>>>>>>> 

Lance didn't tell him who he was in love with. Why should he, when there was no chance of him ever being loved back? 

>>>>>>>>>>

Lance grasped at Coran's shoulder to hold himself upright as the pod opened. 

Coran looked at him, concered. 

"So what's the diagnosis, doc?" he joked wanly as Coran helped him over to the monitor, where he had brought up the image of the scan results. 

"This is pretty bad. I've never seen any illness like this on an Altean... When did this start?" 

"About 3 and a half months ago." He couldn't remember what months felt like anymore. 

"Well... judging by this scan, your alveoli are almost completely blocked off by the roots..." Coran thought a minute, appearing to Lance as if his mind was running marathons a second, going through calculation after calculation. 

Coran was, in Lance's opinion, very intelligent; he just didn't know how to deal with people that well. 

"You have maybe three weeks left." 

Dios mio... So soon? Keith, mi amor, I'm sorry. 

"Ok," Lance said with a wan smile. "I'll make the most of it." 

>>>>>>>>>>

He decided that yes, he would make the most of it. 

"Pidge," Lance called, crouching next to the green paladin as they worked with their computer on some obscure project. "Can you modify my helmet?" 

"What do you need on it? I'm busy, but I might be able to fit it in if it's simple." The light of the screen flashed against their glasses like the shine of a mirror, reflecting the words on the screen. 

"Can you add a button by the mic that sends out the coordinates of the helmet if you press it?" 

Pidge smirked. "Pfft, that's easy, I really don't understand why they don't already have that on there. Hand it over, I'll have it done in a few hours." 

"Thank you, Pidge." The blue paladin handed Pidge his helmet and retreated back to his room. 

>>>>>>>>>

As Lance picked a petal off of his tongue, his face freshly washed, a light tap on his door told him Pidge had arrived. Hastily, he scooped the blooms off of his bed into his little bucket and opened the door. 

"Here you go," the teen said with a smirk as they handed him his helmet. "One upgraded helmet. You're welcome, by the way." 

"Thanks again, Pidge." 

He fit the helmet over his head and felt the button under his pointer finger as they left. 

Good. This is perfect. Easy to reach, too. 

>>>>>>>>>>

He didn't tell Pidge why he needed that upgrade.

The walk down to the pods was the one of a man who knew he was about to die. Slow and steady, Lance breathed in every surrounding as he carried his bucket of flowers, helmet and food goo under his arm. 

His one regret was that he didn't get to see Earth one last time. He would have gone with Keith if he could've, just enjoying the soft expression Keith probably would've had. He would have wanted to see his beautiful hair flow in the wind, his purple eyes soft as he enjoyed being home... but Keith would have probably gone right back out into space again, knowing him. Silly Keith. 

And Lance would have followed him to the ends of the universe if he asked, just to see his smile. 

But at the same time, to Lance, the castle ship was home. Space was home. He loved the galaxies, the weird aliens they met, the stars, the planets, even the shitty food goo. It was what he'd lived with for the past year or two, fighting Zarkon, Lotor and the Galra. He'd miss
