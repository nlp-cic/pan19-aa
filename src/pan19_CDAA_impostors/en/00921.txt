’s most cherished and most beautiful. Of all, he had the purest heart, his wings the purest white like starlight; his full form was so bright that even other angels could hardly stare at him. He was Heaven’s beloved, the entire Host looking up to him in awe and admiration. Hence why it was such a shock that he was the one protesting the Lord now. 

Gabriel cringed as he watched his two big brothers charge at each other, their magnificent wings flaring in rage. He was familiar with the process now; they would fly and crash into one another again and again, tangling in a mess of feathers and light and screams, not caring about the collateral damage in their wake. Not caring about how much they hurt each other, how much they were willing to hurt each other; it horrified Gabriel, made him want to cry out in protest. They were family, his family, how had things changed so much? Why wasn’t Father intervening?

||||| it must be the Key ||||| Raphael had once told him. The Key -and Lock- of Darkness that God had entrusted Lucifer with; it was corrupting him, the Darkness reaching out through the Mark to its bearer. Their brother’s jealousy of Man was growing each day, along with an uncharacteristic aggressiveness to get his point across. Michael was actually no better; initially shocked like everyone else, he was soon enraged at the prospect of anyone defying Father, Key-bearer or not. His devotion was blinding him. 

They were both blinded, mad. 

At Gabriel’s stalling, Raphael tugged at his little brother, suggesting they leave. Gabriel was yet unable to take his eyes off the fighting. He knew trying to stop them was useless, stone-headed big idiots that they were; didn’t make it easier to watch, to stand by helpless. 

 

||||| father ||| stop this |||||

||||| I am begging you to stop them |||||

 

Stars trembled as an old planetary system was crushed below the battle. Millions of desperate prayers scattered like sparks throughout the galaxy, fading away…

 

Silence. 

Worlds turned to dust, innocent lives lost. Again.

No answer from Father. Again.

Two worn brothers that halted in their struggle, weakened by each other. Normally this was the point they would stop, the end of a world more than enough to pull at their deeply buried conscience. Or they would be just tired. Then they could go their separate ways to sulk until the next time they met.

Raphael had long left but Gabriel remained, still shaken by the echoes of dying prayers. His wings, his very grace trembled in horror and sorrow; this had to stop, he couldn’t bear it, the sight of the damage his beloved brothers left on each other and the universe, their wavelengths fluctuating by exhaustion and hurt…

They were gathering themselves. He saw their gazes locking. But, they didn’t turn away. Didn’t leave. Something was wrong. With some effort, Michael flared his wings again. Lucifer strained to do the same.

Gabriel felt a chill at his core. No...

They were still blinded, mad. Except this time, one of them likely wouldn’t survive the next blow.

 

||||| stop ||||| 

 

Gabriel called out to them for the first time, watching in terror as the two took off towards each other yet again. He wasn’t going to stand by this time, he couldn’t. 

 

||||| please ||| no more |||||

 

The air crackled as the blinding light of the older Archangels met in the middle, reached out to drown the other- but an obstacle separated them for the first time, a golden light, smaller yet warmer, placed inbetween just before they touched-

 

||||| NO MORE |||||

 

Gabriel felt the anger and shock, the confusion and the nerve, sudden reluctance of the fairer light, determination of the stronger, a speck of sorrow from both at the last nanosecond-

They were too blinded, too mad to stop.

Every angel at every corner of Heaven had to cringe at the sharpest cry that ever thundered through the Host.

Its reality ripped through their blindness and made them stop, and for a moment they weren’t mad anymore. Michael radiated sympathy and regret and the deepest sorrow and why, while Lucifer was stunned, frozen like a cold statue at the sight of their wounded little brother. The golden light was diminished, the ever golden wings -now tainted with silvery speckles- encasing the shivering form of Gabriel like a cocoon as the young Archangel softly wept, waves of pain and despair echoing in the celeste like a throbbing ache…

 

||||| you should not have stayed || little brother |||||

 

Michael’s voice was the first to disturb the agony. Golden feathers slowly parted, and Gabriel looked up. 

For the first time, the senior Archangels saw the joy of Heaven extinguished from the golden gaze, a stake to their steady wavelengths. Below the shock, their instinct was to reach out, to sooth and protect with their grace, because that’s what big brothers did. But the broken sight told them they had lost the right. Michael pushed down
