warm these days.

Chanyeol doesn't know what the movie is about. He couldn't care less. Baek is wearing his too-big-T-shirt, collarbones out and sharp under the pale skin. Once again the screen goes dark and he can't see a thing, but he knows. He knows they're there, those pretty, maddening collarbones. He wants to touch them. 

No. He needs to. Has to. Must.

He doesn't wait for the answer. He reaches over to caress one of them lightly with his fingers. So soft. So warm. 

But the screen goes bright and he can see the sharp look on his friends face. He doesn't know this emotion, but he takes his hand off anyway.

– Don't touch me like that. Ever.

– Ok, ok, you win!! Aahahaha! I really thought I'm gonna outwit you this time, Channie! – he falls back onto the couch. 

They're at Baekhyun's place.The living room is lit with the sunset. It's warm and cozy here, so unlike the windy cold outside. They've just finished another round of that popular video game every teenager seems to play these days.

– Next time. Maybe. – Chanyeol smiles sheepishly at the other.

– So what's it gonna be, Yeol? What kind of embarrassing shit am I doing this time for letting you win? – Baek pulls his legs into an embrace, placing his chin atop the knees and closing his eyes. They always get sore after their rounds of gaming. – Channie! Come on! Let me out of my misery already! – he whines when minutes pass and there's no response.

– Let me. – A whisper.

– Let you what? – Baekhyun snaps out of his dreamy state to stare at his blue-haired friend. 

– Let me touch your collarbones. Please.

Three months. Ignored by his best friend. Without a chance to explain, to say he's sorry. Granted, they see each other at school. But Baekhyun never even spares a glance in his direction. Like they're even less than strangers. It hurts.

It hurts, even more, a couple of weeks later. Spring hit the town fast and it's like the cold was never here. Chanyeol is done. He wants his best friend back. He's standing in the front of Baek's house. It's almost too dark to see anything in the street. But light coming from the window is quite enough.

Dull golden light shining on their faces, as they stand at the doorstep. Baekhyun in his school uniform looks even more underage than he actually is. All soft and delicate. The boy in front of him. Tall, towering with his broad shoulders. It's not Chanyeol though. 

The boy bends down and you can almost hear it: soft whispering of the trees, TV on inside the house, lips touching lips, shattering of a heart.

The river flows by fast. Sun is setting and it's too early in the spring to sit outside in a simple black suit now. Cold wind seeps through the light fabric, but there was just no time to buy a new, warmer suit for his grandmother's funeral. Chanyeol doesn't care. Nothing makes sense. So he just sits there for hours, shivering and watching the water run past him. Just like life does. Everything hurts.

He needs someone to hold him. But his "someone" is no longer there for him.

He spends a week, maybe more, in his room, in his bed. Never turning the lights, staring at the ceiling. Thinking, remembering, dwelling.

Once again the room goes dark, only to be disturbed by the soft knock on the door hours later. He has to blink some tears away, struggling to adjust to the light that comes from the open door. There's someone familiar there, though it's none of his parents.

It must be a dream.

– Why are you here? – he asks this vision of his.

– Chanyeol... – not a vision then.

– I don't need you anymore. – it's the truth. Only it isn't.

The boy, his best friend, his first heartbreak, closes the door behind him and sits on the corner of the bed.

– How long has it been? – he asks though he doesn't need the answer. – I am so sorry, Channie. – Baekhyun whispers. There are tears in his voice. There are tears in Chanyeol's eyes.

The bright morning light comes softly through the heavy fabric of the curtains. Their faces glow in it and their identical black hair shines, a disarray on the pillow. 

Chanyeol is fast asleep, lying on his right side, a big spoon to his smaller friend. 

Baekhyun is awake, though. More so than he's been for months now. He reaches
