reddening water. How he had made Theta help him drag the body out of the river and into the sharp and silver trees. How they had burned what they could in an afternoon and buried the rest, their robes heavy with water and soil and blood. How Theta had sobbed.

When Koschei looked at Theta Sigma, he saw these memories, and he saw how Theta had looked when Theta wouldn’t look at him, and his hearts crowded in his chest like he was drowning.

So he began to tell himself it didn’t matter. He began to tell himself he was someone who didn’t feel, when in fact he felt more than he ever had before, mostly pain and disappointment and alienation but also tenderness and regret and an inextinguishable, undeserving, exasperated love. It was a self-deception that fitted well with the lie and the hypocrisy their friendship gradually became.

In time other things took place between them, memories piled up like a great midden of broken crockery. Somewhere underneath, the thing that had happened by the river became both mythical and apocryphal. The suppressed recitation of what had taken place became more real than fact.

This is how Time Lords do relativity. Within the song they must sing themselves to keep on existing, it’s a dissonance, this motif, a suspension of proof that transposes unresolved from movement to movement, moment to moment, transmitted cell to cell. It cannot be borne repeating and has will be committed until truth is written and rewritten, markings on the page so heavy with crossings-out and copyings-over that you can feel them in welts and tears from the other side. In the very tangible thing that is Time Lord future, Time Lord past does not yet exist, and what you tell yourself when you are born becomes what you are.

Koschei told himself he was resilient. He told himself that he was clever (this, at least, did not require the suspension of disbelief), and that he would always survive, by wit and by will. He told himself he controlled his own fate. Told himself the cold was not his destiny.

He told himself it did not hurt. He willed himself to believe it.

He missed his friend, the way they had been before. The hand to hold in the dark and the promise projected in time and the story to make sense of together.

He inured himself to pain, painstakingly rewrote that line whenever it was necessary.

And years went by.

They passed each other in the curved corridor on the very last day they would be together, responsibilities and alleigances keeping them apart, each busy in his own preparations, but to Koschei the physical evasion of not stopping, not meeting and touching and sharing hit him as hard as the Doctor’s younger self had, on the very first day, barrelling unseeing into another initiate as he fled from the Untempered Schism.

Then, he had been an unknown boy from another House, yet in that collision even the short, the very short time they had spent not yet in one another’s lives had been obliterated, the contact between them reverberating back and back and forwards forever. Now, his friend had chosen a new name, and seemed unknowably remote, and Koschei wanted only to reach for him, close the distance that had stretched him so thin as to leave tears in his soul.

“Doctor…” The word was strange on his tongue, and felt like it had been chosen to fill his mouth with mud, or ice.

He stopped and made his people wait for him, and he went after his friend, because they had run out of time, because they had never talked. Because of memory. Because he loved his friend more than anything he could name, and they had been meant to dream together, to run together, free in time and space and flight and destiny, one day, and one day had come and they were not running together.

“Thete, please?” he said to the Doctor’s back. His voice skimmed over his throat, breaking on the words.

The Doctor didn’t look at him, and Koschei couldn’t see his face.

It felt like a death. It felt like death.

Because love, it's not an emotion. Love is a promise.



And he will never hurt her.

And now the Doctor has been told not to save her; now he’s been told not to let her live. Now the ground is dust, not mud, and dry; and the water has burned away, and the dead have not been drowned. Now the future that she has practiced is a memory of death, and an infection that’s been burned (a gene that’s been excised); a crime that won’t be repeated. It’s a murder now that won’t be allowed to have happened again and again.

He turns reluctantly to look at his old friend, and he’s trapped in this choice--he can’t let her live and he can’t kill her and he
