"You think I'm hot?" he asked. Ron nodded, but hoped Harry understood what he had said before. Fortunately, he didn't have to worry based on Harry's next comment. "So do you think there might be some other bloke out there to think that also?" asked Harry, his confidence still low from years with the Dursley's.

"Oh Harry, of course they will. You just need to figure out who your type is. Whether it's a girl or a bloke, I still want you to be careful. Blokes like the Harry Potter name as well." reprimanded Hermione. Harry nodded, not the least bit upset. His uneasiness of whether someone wanted to be with him or just his name was one of the reasons he had not gone out much as it was.

"Don't worry Hermione. Remember, he has a thing for Snape and we all know how Snape feels about the Harry Potter name." said Ron, mischievously. Harry threw one of the couch pillows at Ron for his comment.

"Thanks mate. Appreciate it." he mumbled.

"Really Ron. I can't believe you're on that again. I told you, it is completely inappropriate for those two to have a relationship, even if Harry had a crush on him. Not that I am saying you do Harry." assured Hermione, looking at Harry quickly, before turning back to Ron. "I don't know why you wont listen to me!"

"Because I don't think it is. As a matter of fact, I bet there is no rule anywhere that says that a student of legal age and willing consent couldn't be in a relationship with a professor." said Ron, happy he had managed to actually sound smart there. Him spending time with Draco was paying off with his arguments with Hermione.

"I bet you there is." retorted Hermione.

"Fine. You go do your research and when you can come to me with proof that Harry can't shag every professor in this school if he wanted to, then I will drop the idea of him and Snape. But until you do, you can't say a word against it." wagered Ron.

"Fine, I agree. It shouldn't take me long anyways." huffed Hermione, grabbing her bag and walking about of the common room in a huff.

"I swear, you two are like a brother and sister." commented Harry.

"Yeah." said Ron fondly and the two boys sat in silence. Eventually they got up to do homework and when it was bed time they noticed that Hermione had arrived yet.

"I guess it is taking longer that she thought." commented Harry.

"Yup, looks like you'll be able to dream in peace. Tonight anyways." teased Ron.

"Shove off." commented Harry, playfully elbowing his friend as they climbed into bed. Ron laid down with a smile on his face, not failing to notice that Harry had not once rejected Snapes name in the conversations that night.

******************************************************************************************************

It was the next afternoon in potions class that Ron knew his words had affected Harry. Snape was lecturing to the class about the potion that were going to be doing, which obviously Ron wasn't paying any attention to. What he was paying attention to was the way Harry immediately started squirming when Snape had entered the class. It had only increased when Snape had started his lecturing. When Snape had conjured his own cauldron and grasped the wooden handle of the spoon to stir, Harry let out an exasperated sigh and lowered himself into his seat more.

"I was right, wasn't." Ron stated simply, looking at the front of the class, pretending to pay attention. Harry turned his head slightly to look at his best mate and Ron could see a faint blush on the boys cheeks.

"Oh shut it." he said simply, trying to discreetly rearrange his robes, but Ron noticed and his grin grew wider. He couldn't help but glance at Draco, who was giving them an odd look.  Ron gave him a slight nod, his grin going wider. Draco just looked at him in confusion, so Ron glanced at Snape and then back to Harry and then to Snape again. Draco seemed to have gotten the message because his eyes got wide before a smirk graced his face and he looked towards the front of the class again.

Luckily, Harry managed to make it through the rest of the class without incident.  When the class ended, he hopped up as quickly as he could and hurried out of the room, Ron chuckling at the sight.

“Is Harry okay?” asked Hermione in concern as usually the three left together.

“Oh yeah, he’s fine.  I think he needed to go relieve himself in the little boys room.” answered Ron with a wicked grin, leaving Hermione to wondered what it was that she missed.  So wrapped up in her thoughts that she missed the wink that Ron threw the blonde Slytherin's way on his way out.

Unfortunately for Draco, Severus Snape did not.
