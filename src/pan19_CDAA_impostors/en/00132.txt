[20:34] nice to meet you too

 

Reagan

[21:34] Mako wanted me to thank you for the pancake tips

[21:34] We didn’t have blueberries, so we went with peanut butter and bananas

[21:35] Attached image

[21:35] The non-circular one was made by Mako, flipped it by herself

 

Me

[21:36] it’s no problem

[21:36] thank you for following them

[21:37] I thought you guys had work today?

 

Reagan

[21:39] Voice Message

[21:39] Charlie and Sammy have work, so Mako and I used the leftover batter from the last night to make some breakfast

 

Me

[21:42] Voice Message

[21:42] you can let Mako listen to that

[21:43] ah I see

 

[22:20] Hey Reagan, can I ask you something?

 

Reagan

[22:25] Go ahead

 

Me

[22:27] I have a friend who does some hacking as well, and he helps the Golden Crow with some stuff

 

Reagan

[22:27] I know you’re the Golden Crow, Liane

 

Me

[22:28] Ah right, sorry

[22:29] so he helps me do some basic stuff, like turning lights off so I can sneak into a building

[22:29] but, we might need more than that soon

 

Reagan

[22:30] I can get in contact with him if you want to pass his number to me

 

Me

[22:32] That would be great

[22:34] Thank you

[22:34] Attached Contact: Jeremy

 

Reagan

[22:35] No problem

[22:35] Happy to help

 

Me

[22:36] you can tell him you’re a friend of Sunny Girl?

 

Reagan

[22:37] I can just tell him I’m a friend of the Golden Crow

[22:37] if that’s okay

 

Me

[22:38] yeah sure, that’s okay too

 

Reagan

[22:38] The superhero community isn’t small, but it’s not that big anyway

 

Me

[22:42] Ah, I’m not sure if I’m considered a superhero

 

Reagan

[22:43] Up to you to label it, I suppose

[22:44] I know Sammy thinks you are one and I trust her judgment

 

Me

[22:45] Thanks

 

Reagan

[22:45] You’re welcome

 

Me

[22:47] I’m going to head to bed soon, early class tomorrow

[22:47] just wanted to say thanks again

[22:49] for the talk

 

Reagan

[22:50] No problem

[22:50] Good night

Me

[08:07] I don’t…even want to ask

 

Reagan

[08:20] That’s probably for the best, to be honest.

[08:21] Although, I will say that it was Sammy’s idea

 

Me

[08:21] of course it was

 

Reagan

[08:21] So you can ask her about it later

 

Me

[08:22] haha noted

Me

[08:44] it’s alright

[08:44] I’m almost there anyway

[08:44] I just can’t put my phone in my pocket since I can’t really move my hands

 

[sun emoji] SAMMY [sun emoji]

[08:45] you can whatsapp me!!

[08:45] what else are you up to today?

[sun emoji] SAMMY [sun emoji]

[08:48] :O

 

Me

[08:48] so I’ll go to class, then probably see what Lily or Ben are doing

 

[sun emoji] SAMMY [sun emoji]

[08:49] what about your mom?

 

Me

[08:50] she’s going to the main gathering at Central with my aunt, so maybe I’ll see her there later

 

[sun emoji] SAMMY [sun emoji]

[08:51] *flex emoji* x4

[08:51] how are you feeling?

 

[08:54] wow you’re really struggling there

 

Me

[08:55] I feel really weird

[08:55] like I can feel this hum underneath everything

[08:55] but no one is acknowledging
