Please. What do you think I used to write during my classes?



Te pedicabo, Tu dolor in asinum, Et amabis id.


*clears throat*

Well, it’s worth a try
If your hand won’t get tired
Gauntlets free, of course

*waggles eyebrows*

(Translation for our readers: "I'll fuck you in the ass / You pain in my ass / And you will love it")

To Anders:


I’ll give you a pain in your ass… And maybe a pain in your neck to go with it. I know how much you like that combo. Good luck sitting down, tomorrow.


You taught me to cheat
I’m more concerned for your knees
Than my skilful fingers

*removes gauntlets* *cracks Anders across the cheek with one* *tosses them on the floor*

To Fenris:


*purrs* Is that a promise, O Cranky One?


Big words from you, elf.
Put money where your mouth is
And put your mouth—well.

*huffs and rubs his cheek* Throwing the gauntlet, eh? I accept your challenge. *grins and picks up gauntlet*

To Anders:

Oh, do you, now? *steps a whole hell of a lot closer and stares up unsettlingly*

So I should eat your ass
Before I bang it into next week?
Get me more wine first


That was in one of Varric’s books. Doesn’t sound too difficult… Does sound like I should be a lot more drunk.


To Fenris:

*smirks and stares back challengingly* What can I say? I like to live dangerously.

You could feast your eyes
Or you could feast on my flesh
Or are you all talk?


Oh, been reading those books, have you? That explains so much.


To Anders:

Your coat is complex
My solution is violent
Strip it or I will


Isabela’s a fan. Says it’s important I learn to read the best words, first.


To Fenris:

Says the spiky elf.
You want me naked — okay!
Now off with your pants.


Ha! Well, I’d probably remember more of my lessons if they went like that.


To Anders:

*writhes out of skin-tight pants* *tosses them in Anders’s face*

Just the pants, mageflower?
As you wish, so shall I do
But you cheat yourself

*looks vexatiously catlike and smug, if pantsless*

To Fenris:

*flails around pants and tosses them aside*

The pants are a start
Now your breastplate looks silly.
What next, I wonder?


JUSTICE APPROVES OF THIS TALK OF PANTS


To Anders:

*the remaining armour clatters to the unlickable floor* 

No less deadly nude
I like how you look at me
When I remind you


You look good with my pants on your face. You look even better with your pants on my floor.


To Fenris:

Beautifully deadly.
You are my favorite weapon
Slay me at your will.

*smirks and crooks finger at Fenris*

You know what doesn’t look good on your floor? All these dead bodies.

To Anders:


I don’t know, they’ve become part of the décor, over time. The classic ‘Kirkwaller haunted mansion with corpses and shrapnel’ style.


*ducks under Anders’s chin and bites his throat with just enough force to make things interesting*

Slay you? What a waste.
I thought I might impale you
While you strain for breath

*steps back* *runs a finger along that scar* *tips his head toward the bed*


I think we both know I’m too short to do this up against the wall…


To Fenris:


Going for serial-killer chic, I see.


*wraps an arm around Fenris’ waist and pulls him close*

Impaled on your sword?That is a death I won’t mind
If you wield it well.

*shivers, lays back on the bed with a smirk*

To Anders:

*crawls up onto the bed between Anders’s legs*

Maybe a little death,
Struck through with my blue-burned blade?
Grease or spit, mageflower?

*holds out a hand, expectantly*

To Fenris:

*wraps legs around his waist*

Call me ‘mageflower’
And I’m sure to spit on you.
But here — as you will.

*casts grease spell into Fenris’ hand, nips at his ear*

To Anders:

*first applies grease*

Had enough mage-spit
To last me many lifetimes
'Sparklefingers', then?

*then applies knob*

Tight-assed magisters
Always impenetrable
But you? So open.

 To Fenris:

*bites lip*

I’m no magister
I do not need blood magic
To bind you to me.

*traces the lyrium lines on Fenris’ neck with one finger*

To Anders:

*lunges forward and wraps a hand around Anders’s neck*

I am not your slave
Is that your death wish showing?
I will not be bound

*grinds in hard* *realises what just happened* *loosens the death grip a little*

Well done, sparkling one
Did I not move fast enough?
Don’t
