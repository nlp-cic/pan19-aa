left, he wanted to get it over with focusing on his phone while Kurop's intense stare just watched. Kenma clapped of course when he was supposed to, but that didn't ease the nerves of when he would go. 

Kenma knew what he was going to sing, he knew exactly what sounded like him and his friend. Kenma frowned more than he was already, thinking about how the bet was a lost cause yet only this many of them actually failed. He sighed.

"Kenma, don't you have to go? We've been waiting for about 5 minutes and no one has done a thing. I can tell it's bothering ya' but just get it over with." Kuroo failed to keep the anxious feeling out of his voice.

"I can't really sing, Kuroo." Kenma said quietly, scrunching over a bit more, "But, yeah, I do have to go."

"I haven't heard you sing, but you're probably fine. Oikawa and Akaashi set the bar high enough that you can break it, just try to keep your volume up." The black haired Tetsu said with a grin, continuing to encourage his gamer friend to go up there.

Kenma shrugged, shoving his phone in his pocket and heading to the stage, climbing up on the high wooden wall and walking to Nishinoya. He seemed too excited to be making everyone sing.

Kenma then took the mic, hearing the pinball machine in the background and looking at the lyrics he already knew, turning away from the speaker and cleaning his throat before starting, 

"Swinging in the backyard
Pull up in your fast car
Whistling my name

Open up a beer
And you say, "Get over here
And play a video game."

I'm in his favorite sun dress
Watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown

I say, "You the bestest."
Lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on

Go play a video game

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby, now you do

Singing in the old bars
Swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame

Kissing in the blue dark
Playing pool and wild darts
Video games

He holds me in his big arms
Drunk and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of

Watching all our friends fall
In and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby, now you do

Now you do
Now you do
Now you do

Now, now you do
Now you do
Now you do

It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby, now you do."

Kenma felt his cheeks flush with both embarrassment and to find Kuroo was in the closest seat possible to the stage. When the music stopped, he gave back the microphone, screaming inside but not showing it. Bokuto and Akaashi were in the booth again by the looks of it, but Kenma needed a bit of time.

Getting off the stage, he went to the bathroom and took out his phone, attempting to calm down from his confession. 

The door swinged open and Kenma hoped it wasn't Kuroo with his entire existence, but no such luck.

"Hey Kuroo," He played it as cool as possible, the deep red on his face flaring.

"I'm surprised that you chose the bathroom over going back to the booth, you just seem to be demanding attention." He winked, Kenma put his phone even closer as if it would hide the flustered face of his. He didn't even know what to say or do at the comment.

What Kenma didn't notice was how close his friend had gotten. His heart raced for the finish line and the destination of its end, but Kenma knew that Kuroo didn't really have the heart for being this sly.

Another inch closer, "So... Is this the part where I get to confess my feelings back?"The captain fiddled wit his fingers and the only way his setter knew was because their shoulders were touching
