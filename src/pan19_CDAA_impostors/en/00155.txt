ravers since he woke up, totally useless."

Cas turned to Meg, "Would you look at her. My caretaker. All that thorny, pain, so beautiful."

"We've been over this, I don't like poetry. Put up or shut up."

Dean looked down, Sam spoke up, "Okay so Cas you said you woke up last night?"

Cas perked, "Yes I heard a ping that pierced my. Well you wouldn't have known unless you were an angel at the time."

Sam handed Cas the bag holding the brick, "It's also when we opened this."

Cas held it, "Oh yes. Now I understand."

"Understand what?"

"You were the ones. Huh, guess that make sense."

Dean perked at that, "What makes sense?"

Cas picked up the brick, "Well if someone was going to free the word. It would be you two. Oh I love you guys." He pulled the two brothers into a hug.

"Ya okay," They patted him on the back.

~~~~~~~~

"Don't like conflict." Cas vanished and the word fell.

"The hell was that?"

"You heard him, don't like conflict. Down in the dayroom I can guarantee that."

Dean rolled his eyes, "Okay I'll go after Cas, Sam will you pick up the.. Word of God?"


"Ya."

~~~~~~~

Meg stood in the doorway, "-Let me just go get my angel." She walked down the hall.

Sam ran to catch up to her,"Meg. Wait, What are you talking about?"

"Who do you think he will come too? You heard him, thorny beauty blah blah. I'm the one who stayed with him. He owes me. His words."

"You know what him and Dean were. Besides, what are you going to do with a broken angel?"

"I'll take power where I can get it. I got myself to look out for."

~~~~~~~~~

Dean rounded the table, looking at Cas, he feels like a father scolding their kid, "You realize you just broke God's word."

Cas looked off to the side, Dean sat down, "It's Sam's thing isn't it? You taking on his cagematch scars."

Cas just stared at him,"I'm guessing that's what broke your bank. Right?"

Cas finally spoke, "Well it took everything to get me here."

Dean shook his head, "What are you talking about man?"

"Dean. I know you want different answers."

"No what I want is, You button up that coat, help us take down leviathans, to come back with me."

Cas stared at him, "Do you remember what you did?"

Cas picked up the sorry box and held it for a second. He shook it and the game appeared.

"Do you want to go first?"

~~~~~~~~

Cas was talking crap. Dean was trying to talk realistic and Cas didn't want to hear it.

"We live in a sorry universe. Why do I prosper from your loss? I don't mAke the rules."

"You made some of them. When you tried to become God, cut that hole into that wall."

"Dean. It's your move."

Dean banged his fist and shoved the game off the table, "Forget the damn game!"

Cas looked down, Dean softened, "Forget the game bab-Cas."

Cas looked up at him, "I'm sorry, Dean."

Dean shook his head, "No you're playing sorry."

Cas looked at him confused.

~~~~~~~~~~~

Dean stared at Cas picking up the pieces.

He couldnt, just Cas. He was so broken. His Cas.

Cas looked up with a smile, "What?"

"Sam. He's talking to angels."

Dean hated that he had to vanish Cas but the others needed to go. 

Cas popped back in the car and it stung when he asked if Meg was hurt. She doesn't love him. Doesn't even care about him, not like how he does.

Dean asked about the angels and Cas started to reply but then went off topic.

"Cas! Don't make me pull this car over."

Cas looked at Dean, "Are you angry? Why are you angry?"

"No I-I'm. Please can we just stay on topic." Dean was a lot of things right now; mad, angry, jealous, gulty, but most of all hurt.

~~~~~~~~

At the cabin Cas was playing with something, he said to Sam, "You seem troubled. Though, that seems to be a majority of your personality so I usually just ignore it."

Sam sighed, "No I'm- I'm just mostmy wondering about you."

"What about me?"

Cas looked at Sam, "You're worried about the burden I lifted from you."

"I couldn't take the weight of everything I did. How I hurt you.
