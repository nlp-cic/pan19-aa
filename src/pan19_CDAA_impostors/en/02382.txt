able to- knowing that if she pressed he’d drop his resistance in a second- when the front door swung open. Mrs. Dupain-Cheng walked in with bags in her arms, keys jingling. Marin rushed to take the groceries from her, smiling as he gave her a peck on the cheek. 

	“Hi, Maman.” 

	“Hello, Croissant,” she smiled up at him, making his ears turn red. 

	“Maman!” he spoke in a low voice and nodded at his friends who were already giggling, “Not in front of them.”

	 She chuckled then looked at the other teenagers with her welcoming smile, “Hello all of you.” 

	Alim stood up and gave her a side hug, “Hey, Sabine.” 

	“Hello, ma’am,” Adrienne smiled politely.  

	“Mrs. D-Cheng!” Nina grinned, “Love the keychain!” 

	Sabine laughed softly, “My little crafter made it.” She gave the little beaded dragon a shake, Marin smiled as he started putting away the groceries. 

	“Hey, Sabine, we’re going to one of street fairs in the city,” Alim wrapped an arm around Marin’s shoulders, “And we’re hoping we can have Marin for the rest of the day?” 

	The girls nodded, looking to her hopefully. Marin sheepishly smiled at her too as she placed her hands on her hips, giving him a cocky look. 

	“Young man, you did finish your chores?” 

	“Yes, I did. Papa gave me a break just now when they came over.” 

	“It is a slow day, so go ahead. I just want you back early in the evening for closing time.” 

	“Thank you,” he kissed the top of her head, his friends happy to have him joining after all. 

	“One more thing,” Sabine tapped his chest, “You have flour on your clothes. And on your cheek.” He rolled his eyes as she rubbed it off with her thumb. 

	“Thanks, Maman,” he grinned, before taking the stairs two at a time to change, a bit embarrassed. Oh how did he not notice with Adrienne there? 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Adrienne munched delightfully on the cookies, savoring the sweet chocolate. Oh, how could she have lived without these? Her mother rarely ever let her eat junk food- she had a strict diet being a model after all. But when Nina had first offered her snacks during break, she couldn’t decline and found out about all the food she’d missed out on. 

	It’s true she’s self-conscious these days about her diet getting a little off, especially if her mother was going to scold her about her weight. Except, she did exercise, considering how much activity she does as Chat Noire. And Nina always gave such reassurance, that she wasn’t afraid to snack on sweets every once in a while. 

 	Especially from the Tom & Sabine’s Boulangerie Patisserie. Oh, how she loved Marin’s family bakery! 

	“Goodness,” Nina gave her an incredulous look, “Did you really have to take a free sample from everything?” 

	“Not from everything,” Adrienne protectively weighed the box stacked with different pastries and cookies in her hand, “You couldn’t fit a piece of all that beautiful food in one box.”

	Nina only rolled her eyes as she leaned against the front window of the bakery, the girls and Alim (while checking for any news streams of the local superheroes on his phone) waited for Marin outside. 

	“Besides,” she added, brushing crumbs from her shirt front, “Mr. Dupain-Cheng insisted I take some. And I did buy a few biscuits!” 

	“You and that smelly cheese,” she shook her head, “And only because you were practically drooling over ‘some’ of the food.” 

	“Har har, I don’t drool,” Adrienne raised her chin. 

	“Oh yes, I forgot. Cats don’t drool, do they,” Nina teased, Alim looking up quizzically on the remark. 

	“Inside joke,” they both said, before giggling. 

	“Whatever,” he rolled his eyes, sighing impatiently, “Marin always has to be late.” 

	“No I don’t!” 

	The boy stepped out, calling back a goodbye to his parents with a wave. Adrienne smiled softly at him; it was really endearing seeing shy Marin with his family. It was honestly such a sweet thing to witness a knit-tight family, especially the good-natured relationships they all held. 

	“Ready?” Alim grinned as he swung an arm around his best friend.

	Marin returned the grin, “For sure.” 

	“Good,” Nina looped her arm through Adrienne and pumped a fist up, “Let’s go have some fun!” 

	They laughed and began walking down the sidewalk. It was such a nice day, warm for autumn and Adrienne was glad she could wear her jean shorts if only for today.
Flipping her hair down and letting her blonde tresses fall past her shoulders, free from her hair tie, Adrienne laughed as she skipped on ahead.  She did a little twirl to look back at
