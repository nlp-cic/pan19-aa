so much help, you hadn't once let him read anything you had written or view anything you had drawn. You were very wary about letting others see your manga, especially since it was only in its early stages.

When Mayuzumi resumed with his reading and you had returned to your quiet sketching, the door to the terrace was suddenly sent flying. Your trusted friend, Matsukawa Nanami, rushed towards you with ragged gasps; it were as if she had just run up four flights of stairs in one breath. You quickly closed your sketch book, placing it in your bag just as Nanami practically leapt into your arms.

"Y/N-chan! T-Ta-Tachibana was be-beaten-" you intervened her jargon with the advice to breathe before letting her continue, "b-beaten up by the delinquents!"

You glanced at Mayuzumi who appeared indifferent to the news, or rather, too absorbed in his book. You turned back to Nanami who continued to fumble over her words, eyes darting nervously from one distraction to the next. She about flinched when a leaf carried by the wind tapped her shoe.

"Okay. Let's go see if Tachibana's okay," you resolved, pulling your bag onto your shoulder.

Tachibana laughed nervously when you questioned him about the serpentine wound across his cheek. When he assured you it was no big deal, you flicked the wound gently with your finger, watching monotonously as he doubled over in pain and mumbled an almost inaudible curse.

You didn't know much about the delinquents at your school, nor did you ever see them. You were almost always stuck in your club room with your trusty otaku friends, gushing about the latest releases... and your favourite anime characters. Despite being manga obsessed, barely anyone in your class held any disgust or scorn for you regarding that. There was one exception, but she wasn't a matter on your mind at this current moment.

"You've gotta be careful," you reminded Tachibana, stretching your arms behind your back. "You always say things that tick people off without realising."

Tachibana gave a jocular smile in response, which you almost found irksome. "I'll be sure to take your advice since you're the smartest in the school, Y/N-chan."

A sour, wry smile traced your lips as you relived the unpleasant memories that came with being number one academically within your entire cohort. You had studied endlessly to arrive to the top and had engraved formulas, theorems, and scores into your brain with blood-red nails to satisfy your parents. Albeit, they still weren't satisfied.

"You learnt martial arts at a young age, right?" Tachibana remembered, chuckling playfully. "Oh! Maybe you're the only one who stands a change against those delinquents! You could totally beat them up and become a manga hero, like the ones you write about in your stories."

Now, you understood why he received that nasty wound in the first place. If Seirin's delinquents hadn't gotten there first, it would have been your fist that had blistered his face. It almost made you feel better just thinking about it.

You never intended to get involved.

It was almost as if you were the protagonist of a manga. The way things were about to be set out would haul you into an endless loop of drama.

"Mayuzumi?"

To find the man sitting on the sill of the window at the end of the hallway was your first surprise of the afternoon. You had returned from the faculty office with the papers your teacher had wanted you to hand out to the members of your class. You didn't see the need to proceed with such hospitable tasks, but your teacher had so graciously offered to lend you the recent volume of Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun. You couldn't say no. You really couldn't say no - that volume sold out fast.

"Sensei, you sure do know the quickest way to my heart," you had mused, earning a rather effulgent grin from her.

Now, the papers were becoming a burden as you stopped to talk to the grey haired male. "What are you doing here?" You paused to catch a piece of paper that almost escaped your grasp. "You're usually on the terrace of the third-year's building. Did someone take your spot?"

Mayuzumi's even breathing didn't falter as he spoke.

"Yes."

"That's rude," you muttered, turning around to find the assholes and lay it straight. That was not only Mayuzumi's usual spot, but also the only place where you could sit with him for minutes upon minutes in comfortable peace and silence. You liked to lean against the metal fencing as you observed Mayuzumi sitting on the bench, reading a new book with a smile in his eyes (-since he rarely ever smiled with his lips). You didn't want that to end, and so you would have to politely ask the intruders to leave.

"Where are you going?" Mayuzumi suddenly inquired, sounding too serious to
