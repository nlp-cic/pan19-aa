thickly.

The door opened and the visitor entered. To his surprise, it was the detective Ema Skye and as always was devouring the snack bag, Klavier observed that she was carrying under his arm a brown folder.

- What happens Fräulein?- he ask

- * MUNCH ** MUNCH ** MUNCH *- was the answer.

- Fräulein Skye –he told her- I'm very busy, what is the reason from his unexpected visit?

The inspector suddenly stopped eating and approached him placing the folder under his noses.

-I bring you the folder with the autopsy report of your last case - she reply him.

-Danke -he said- I will read it before trial.

-Obviously- she watched him with a little smile- I do not think I need to remind you that it's morning, although you have been so distracted these days, maybe is good remind you this.

-Distracted? –he asked her confused.

-Yeah –she answered him- you look more off than usual.

- What do you mean, ja? - he asked again.

- You're not the same pompous jerk of always- she said.

- I'm the same as always-he replied annoyed with himself for the fact that someone had noticed something.

- Guess what? You can fool everyone, including yourself- she said- but eventually that won't be good.

-Danke schön Fräulein Skye for bringing me the report- he said faking a smile- you can leave.

-And you know something else? - she asked him- when you really smile your eyes shine.

- Have you noticed in my eyes, ja? - the prosecutor replied.

-Yeah, well ... -she admitted with a slight blush on the cheeks-but we're not talking about that!

- And we're talking about? –he asked her.

-I know you are hiding something-she answered him- I don't know if I've ever said that you can trust me and tell me anything. I will listen to you.

-I do not need your charity-he said- I have millions of friends who can listen my sorrows and give me their best tips.

- Oh, yeah?- ask the researcher rather annoying- where are they now, eh? Because I see you alone, depressed and playing what should be the next hit for one of that group of depressed teenagers.

Alone... that word nail in his soul with a cutting precision… he doesn't want to admit that at that time there was no one to help him, but he couldn't recognize it and less to her.

-I'm not alone –he said- and I don't need anybody.

-Are you sure about that? - she asked him pressing more.

-Verdammt! – he shouted looking away.

-Gavin ... what's wrong? -she asked him in a soft voice-This isn't you.

- What happens to me ? I'm feeling like shit –he answer- probably if now someone shoots me I won't feel pain.

- But why?-she asked- you want to talk?

No, he didn't want to talk but nothing cares now, it was a long time since he cared about something, he needed to talk about it and she had volunteered, so they would talk. Nothing else matters. Althought his pride protested because it didn't want the researcher to laugh at him, he needed to trust her.

- I wonder how I have not been able to see what happened with Daryan, see how my brother was actually –he confessed- I'm feeling guilty of many things that could have been avoided but I didn't.

- What has happened is not your fault Klavier –she said- you aren't responsible for the acts your brother has committed or those of Daryan.

- But I feel that I failed them –he said- I feel alone, lost. Now I have nothing so deserves keep fighting. I don't know how…how I'm still breathing If I don't want to breath.

-Are you serious? - she asked him with a bit of fear in her voice- Klavier… Have you thought about ...?

-Ja –he said- a couple of times. but I haven't been able to do, I guess I'm a coward. I can't stand more.

Ema took one hand to his chest and and with the other stroked gently the prosecutor's chin making him lift the look and could see the tears of the young prosecutor in his eyes.

She never thought of the possibility that something like that happened to him, she knew him well enough to believe that he could not be as sentimental or get depressed until that extreme. Where is her glimmerous fop ? She missed him, at that time she wished that prosecutor that she knew and whose behavior detested came back. If she could get him back,she would do it.

-Listen me Klavier Gavin- she said- you aren't a
