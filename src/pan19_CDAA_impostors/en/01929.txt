couple." She nodded and moved on to a different subject. I was damn glad she did too!

 

I woke up and went to get some apple juice. That's right, it was an apple juice day today. I think I was starting to get a cold. I cuddled up with Larry and my Louis blanket, sipping my apple juice when I heard a knock on the door. I groaned and got up.

 

I opened the door, Louis blanket wrapped around myself, clutching Larry to my chest. Louis smiled at me and laughed.

 

"Don't judge." Louis smiled. I stepped aside so he could come in. He hugged me and of course, I hugged back. He was about to pull away, but I groaned. "No, you're warm." Louis chuckled. We sat down in the living room. "What are you doing here?" I asked.

 

"Uh, I sort of have to tell you something."

 

"What?"

 

"Harry, I have feelings for you. Ever since I met you, you were just so adorable to me. I always want to see you because I love hanging out with you. I love spending time with you. You just really make me happy. I always have awesome days with you. You make me feel special." He stopped and looked down. I smiled widely. What?! He likes me?! What?! He-What?!

 

"Y-You like me?" Louis nodded, looking up. I smiled. I grabbed his face and crashed our lips together.

 

I pulled away. Louis smiled and bit his lip. I hugged him and he hugged back. We pulled away and I pecked his lips.

 

"I like you too, Louis." He smiled, but then frowned. "What?"

 

"What are we supposed to do about Management?"

 

"We'll figure it out." Louis smiled and kissed me. Louis stood up.

 

"Let's go somewhere."

 

"Where?"

 

"I don't know, just somewhere!" He dragged me out of my own house. Atleast, he let me get my jacket. We got in his car and he drove us to Tesco's. I laughed.

 

"Haha, Tesco's. You sure know how to make a man feel special." Louis cracked up and reached over, kissing my cheek. We walked in together. Louis looked around and grabbed my hand. I looked around and then smiled. Louis bought a few things and it was the same lady at the register when I went.

 

She smiled at me and Louis' hands.

 

"Hi, Harry. Hi, Louis."

 

I stayed at Louis's last night. We got called to his Modest's office really early in the morning. We were still in our pajamas and Louis drove us. We tiredly walked into Modest's office and sat down. Paul was in there.

 

"Ahh. Louis, Harry, hello."

 

"Hi."

 

"You've been caught!"

 

"What?" Louis asked.

 

"So, I'm guessing you two have some sort of relationship."

 

"Why? What? Why?" I asked tiredly.

 

"You were seen holding hands at Tesco's! Guys, I don't care if you two are dating, but you have to keep it on the down low. We need teenage girls to think you are irresistible! If they know you're gay, they won't think you're irresistible, they'll just think you're gay!"

 

"Well, we are."

 

"I don't care. We need fans in that area! Nobody can know that you two are gay!"

 

"That's kind of ridiculous, don't you think? It's not like I'll lose that many fans." Louis said.

 

"You never know, Louis. You never know."

 

We sat there, being lectured on how to act and what to say, and what to do and just ugh!

 

"Okay, I know you guys know how to act and whatever around each other. But if you two mess up, it's bad. So, I'll give you guys a little back up. Eleanor, come in here!" A girl with curly brown hair and brown eyes walked in. She was pretty. "Louis, Eleanor is going to be your cover up." Louis and I stared at her.

 

"What?!" Louis and I said simultaneously.

 

"Relax, you only have to be dating to the public eye. You'll have to be seen in public a lot, holding hands, hugging, and maybe even kissing if it gets that extreme." Louis looked at me. I looked down at my lap. I didn't want anyone to see me cry. Louis noticed and patted my leg.

 

"I love you." He whispered in my ear. I smiled.

 

"I love you too."

 

I was in a terrible mood today. I hated Modest. I hated life. I hated everything. Life was just so ugh!

 

I laid on the couch
