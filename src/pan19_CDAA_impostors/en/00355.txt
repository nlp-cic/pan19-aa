of them got to be asked truth or dare," Ashido explained, and put the bottle on the ground,

"Let's play!" she said, and spun it,

 

Midoriya's green eyes glared at the bottle, as if he's trying to command the bottle not to land in front of him, and it seems that it work as it lands in front of Uraraka,

"Uraraka Ochako~ truth or dare?" Ashido asked, a grin displayed on her face,

With confidence, Uraraka answered truth, Ashido thought for a while and then bluntly asked,

"Do you think Aizawa-sensei is cute?"

"What the fuck," Bakugou asked, the boys' faces now have confusement  displayed, all of them literally staring with confused looks to the girls,

"Now you said it, i think he is," Uraraka said,

"whaT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE," Kaminari asked, half shouting the words and muttered "i don't get girls, this is why i'm gay," afterwards,

"His hair's so fluffy it gives a cute vibe i guess," Uraraka said, chuckling,

"That is completely wrong! students cannot have romantic feelings towards their own teachers, Uraraka-san!" Iida said, doing the weird thing with his hands like he always do when he's talking or scolding someone, typical mom,

"I do not have any romantic feelings for Aizawa-sensei, i just thought he's cute that's all! it's a compliment," Uraraka said,

 

[A/N: hmu if you fucking love aizawa with all of your heart, soul and life, because i do]

 

"I heard from Shinsou that he loves cats and has like, five of them in his home," Ojirou said,

"That's adorable," Hagakure said,

"OKAY! Uraraka, spin the bottle please," Kirishima said, getting minded by the conversation, and Uraraka spun the bottle, continuing the game,

 

Through out the whole game, Kaminari was dared to sing the pokemon theme song, Kirishima was dared to dance to Red Velvet's 'Red Flavour' which ends up pretty hilarious, Tokoyami admitted that he's still emo over Chester Bennington's death, Tsuyu was dared to kiss Uraraka in front of the others, Jirou was dared to sit on Yaoyorozu's lap throughout the whole game, Ojirou revealed that he and Shinsou are indeed dating, and more things happened,

 

Midoriya indeed enjoyed it, he laughed along with the others, all of this made him forgot about the fight with Todoroki, until,

"Midoriya! truth or dare?" Jirou asked,

Midoriya thought carefully for a while, and made up his mind, "truth" he chose,

Bluntly, Jirou asked, "what's going on with you and Todoroki? you two aren't all lovey dovey to each other like you used to for like, a week or so? did you two had a fight?" 

 

The rest knew Jirou brought up this question to actually know about what actually happened between the two, but not Midoriya nor Todoroki, the green haired male stole a glance to the red and white haired male sitting not too far from him, who caught his glance and looked away immediately, as if he doesn't give a flying fuck about it,

A sigh escaped Midoriya's lips, and he slowly spoke with a gloomy expression and a straight, dead tone, "we did have a fight, it's when i returned from my task, fought a villain, had to use my quirk on full power, and broke my hand once again, Todoroki told me that i'm too reckless, which is true, but i'm just so stupid and dumb that i don't care about myself and put others first, though that's who i really am, always caring about the others first,"

Midoriya took a breather, trying to hold his tears falling from his green eyes,"we fought, shouted at each other, until he said, that he's scared that, if my hands got paralyzed, i..won't be able to do a lot of things properly, and i..can't comfort him, love him, wipe his tears away, i won't be able to hold him properly since my hands would be paralyzed, and ever since, we...didn't talked about it, or just, try to fix things up, we just, ignore eachother straight away, and ever since, we didn't...talked,"

 

Silence filled the mess hall, they were right, absolutely right about it, but hearing Midoriya's explanation, it made them feel bad for Todoroki but also surprised that he's able to think that far,

"But hey, let's not talk about that, it's only mine and his problem, there's no need to worry about it, it's not that important to any of you, right?" Midoriya said, chuckling, a fake smile displayed on his face,

The others stared at him, worried,

"Midoriya, why
