Dear Sherlock,

I don't really know what I'm meant to be saying. I miss you Sherlock, but I don't really know why. You weren't exactly my best friend were you? You barely saw me, you wouldn't even have noticed if I had fallen off the face of the earth but now you have everything is falling apart. I think I'm going to lose my job and John, I don't even know what to think about John anymore, he's not the same and I don't think he ever will be. You've broken him. But I'm not meant to be talking about him. I'm meant to be talking about me. I had just started to feel… visible when you jumped. And now I'm going back to being a wallflower. I can't adjust to a world without Sherlock Holmes. It's weird. St Bart's is quiet and lonely. I know you never really saw me, but I saw you and that made me feel less lonely. And, thank you, Sherlock.

Love Molly.

I have written this letter purposely ambiguously so you don't know whether Molly knows whether Sherlock survived or not. So interpret that how you want.

Dear Sherlock,

Our therapist's had us all do this, right. Because it's been a year. And I think it's stupid but the force made me go to compulsory therapy; Molly had the same from St Bart's. Anyway, our therapists have been talking; mine and John's and Molly's and Mrs Hudson's that is, and they have decided we need to write you a letter telling you how we feel. And we're not allowed to talk about anyone else. Which is equally stupid. This whole thing is stupid. But I'm doing it anyway. I'm still DI at the Yard but I doubt that will be the case for much longer. We haven't solved anything major for a while, only manslaughter's where the suspect has confessed. That type of thing. I say for a while, I mean since you've gone. I've been drinking a lot too, with John. It's been… sobering, ironically. We've talked a lot when's we've been drinking and I'm not sure if it has helped either of us. It might have. We miss you Sherlock, we need you at the Yard and weirdly, I think we, all of us, need you the rest of the time too. In some way or another. You were more than a colleague to us, or me at least, and I miss you as a friend. But like I said, this whole thing is stupid. There's no point. You're dead .

From Greg. (That's Lestrade, in case you forgot)

Dear Sherlock,

It's been a year and I've barely managed to keep it together the whole time. It still hurts whenever I think of you but I'm not sure what else to say. I'm only writing it because my therapist is making me. My limp has come back, I've tried to stop using my cane but I can't. Greg has even tried taking it away from me, but when he does I just don't go out. So he's started taking me to the pub instead. Which isn't better really because then I can't walk because I am blind drunk. But it allows me to talk, more than with my therapist, even if I often don't remember the conversations the next day. I think it helps a little. I wish I could tell you about Molly and Mr Hudson and everyone else but I've been told not to talk about anyone else. Just me. Not that I am actually talking to you. Because you're dead. So I can't talk to you. I want you to know one thing though. I need to say one thing. I was so alone before I met you, and you made it better and now I owe you so much and I will never be able to pay you back. And I say this to myself almost every day, even though I know it's impossible.

Please don't be dead.

Love John.

Dear Sherlock,

I am not seeing a therapist, unlike the others. And I know you're not dead either. But everyone else is writing silly, sentimental letters to you because it's the anniversary of your death and I've decided to join the trend. You need to come back Sherlock. It's killing the Yard, they never catch anyone anymore. That plain girl from St Bart's, Molly Hooper, she's lost a lot of weight. I think she's suffering without you. Mrs Hudson seems to be okay on the surface, I think she's being strong for
