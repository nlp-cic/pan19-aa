Lance
So… Me and Keith decided to get drunk

Shiro
While I find that to be a poor decision it doesn’t surprise me, so?

Lance
Well, I’m only a little tipsy, Keith is kind of smashed but
I’m honestly about to freak out

Shiro
Is everything ok!?
Are you both ok!?

Lance
Oh yeah we’re fine
Well I think we are
I am at least
but Keith…

Shiro
Lance Istg if you don’t tell me what’s going on right

Lance
Alright alright
Keith is crying

Shiro
WHY!!??

Lance
I have no idea
4 drinks in he decided to go to the zoo and I went with
and it was fine for awhile, not many people here so no one cares if we’re a bit drunk
but we went to the hippo enclosure
and one of the babies yawned
and Keith just sat down and started crying

Shiro
Oh my god, what’s he saying

Lance
I don't know!
He’s not speaking english
wait let me take a video
[video attached]

The camera takes a minute to focus on Keith, too close to Keith’s face to be a good angle. That didn’t matter though cause Keith was a blubbering mess anyways. He kept wiping tears from his eyes and mumbling things. The camera pulled back and swiveled around to show three hippos behind a fence, two adults and a baby. The camera swiftly went back to Keith as he let out a hiccuped sob, voice picking up enough for it to actually be heard.

“그것은 너무 귀여워”

Lance’s voice can be heard from behind the camera, sounding mildly panicked “Keith please, I don’t know what you’re saying”.

Keith just gestures helplessly at the animals in front of him “나는 너무 귀여워 죽고 싶어”. He has to wipe his eyes again then and the video ends.

Shiro
I
I’M SO HAPPY YOU GOT THAT ON VIDEO

Lance
WHAT IS HE SAYING

Shiro
He’s saying that he can’t handle how cute the hippos are
I’ve never gotten that on video before
Thank you so much

Lance
wait
wait
what
Keith just broke down because they were too cute

Shiro
Yes
this is everything I’ve ever wanted
get him home safe and show him the video when he’s sober
please, PLEASE, tell me what he does

Lance
If I get murdered because of this it’s on you

Lance does get Keith home and in bed and ends up staying the night instead of walking back to his apartment. He gets up a bit before Keith and makes them breakfast with the limited things in Keith’s fridge and makes Keith coffee and makes sure he’s not going to throw up after Keith finally get’s up, with a hangover of course.

Only after all that, when Keith is sitting and starting to eat, does he turn the video on and put it in front of Keith. He can’t help smirking as Keith’s eyes go wide and his face goes white before it goes a bright red. It’s silent for a moment after the video ends before Keith clears his throat and speaks “do you understand-”.

“Shiro told me what it meant” Lance interrupts.

Keith groans and dropped his head to the table “Shiro saw that”.

Lance shrugged “I thought something was wrong, I sent him the video”.

Keith just groaned louder “no no no no, he’s never gonna let me live this down”.

Lance smirked, leaning over the table a bit “what makes you think I’ll let you live this down either”.

Keith glared at him, face still a startling shade of pink yet still somehow threatening as he growled “내가 너를 싫어한다면 너를 죽일거야”.

Lance gulped “what does that mean”. Keith just stood slowly, moving around the table toward him “Keith, buddy, my guy, what did you just say”. Keith still didn’t answer, almost to Lance’s side of the table “.... Keith”.

Lance screamed and toppled out of his chair before running toward the living room when Keith started chasing him.

Lance
so I showed him the video

Shiro
oh my god, how did it go

Lance
well he definitely tried to kill me
but he’s still hungover and he ended up tripping and falling face first on the couch so I’m safe I guess

Shiro
how red did he get

Lance
SO RED SHIRO IT WAS AMAZING
He knows you have the video though so watch your back lmao

Shiro
it’s well worth the danger to have this kind of leverage
