In the end, he will be dead
And I'll will feel relief 

Run while you still can 

Run!!

////////////////

Dream held his knees close as Ink and Blue tried to cheer him up . He couldn't be happy . It was dark . 

"Dream , it's been a month. I know your still grieving and that's ok. You still have to go own " Ink said 

His head shot up, "Say that again ? You were not like this when Error died !! It took you months before you could get out of bed !!!"

Ink winced looking down . His husband had been murdered almost two years ago by the same person . He never went after the person because they had suddenly disappeared without a trace .

"Dream !! Don't you dare push us away !! We are trying to help you !!"Blue said 

Dream glared without much hate behind it before he broke down again . The two held him knowing this was going to be long day 

////////////////

Glow pulled at the chains and yelled , "Dust get me out !!"

He kept yelling as flashbacks happened to when he had killed Error to that lady .

He was a horrible person to even think he couch be free.

 

(Play Confrontation from Jekyll and Hyde)

Glow:
My fears have come to play
I try to run
I tried to listen to her
But his control,it's stuck over me 

I try to free myself .
The chains they drag
Behind me as I walk
Knowing that I am alone  

Do I have a good soul?
Do I have a bad soul?
It's such a fine lin, between a good soul and mine 

Dust:
Do you really think that I will ever let you go?

Did you think you were free? 

If you do,it's sad to say,that it will never happen 

You will never get away from me 

Glow:
All that you are is a murder !!
They will stop you from your evil deed 

Dust:
You think that they could stop me !!
Your trying to make me laugh 

Glow:
All that you are is the end of my nightmares
All that you are is my past
After they come ,they will see the truth 

Dust:
They will never see the truth
Because you were the one Kill
They will make sure your die
Painfully 

I will make sure they they find you
No matter what I do
and I will rejoice once you are finally gone 

Glow :
Soon i will tell them the truth of everything you did to me 

Dust:
How will you tell if your mouth is sealed ?
I will make sure they never find out 

Glow:
I don't care if I have to die
I don't care if I even live
Just as long as your dead and gone !!

Dust:
I won't let you win ever
I have made sure of this
I know that they will always, put the blame on you because it was by your hand !!

Glow:
Can't you see that
Your plan will never work 

Dust:
I know it will 

Glow:
If I die,I'll make sure you do to

Dust;
I will make sure you can never come back 

Glow :
Damn you Dust!! Let me be !! 

Dust:
Can't you see this is your death 

Glow:
No! I have to live !!

Dust: (spoken)
Haha I will make sure they kill you in the end . Say goodbye Glow, I will once again win

Glow fell to his knees as his tears fell as Dust left . He pulled on the chains not wanting to pay for his crimes . He did this but it was so hard to want to do it. A shadow looked over him as he eyes widened in fear. 

He looked up at the dark figure and tried to talk but couldn't . Dust had sealed his voice. The figure looked angry and ready to kill. 

He took deep breaths as it spoke. "You did this . You killed everyone . All my friends have grieved are you proud of yourself ? I wouldn't be . " it said as it form became clear . It was Night .
