site had lasted all of two minutes. It didn’t seem to occur to the cadets that proper anonymity might be a good idea in such an environment. Clearly he had some things to get into their thick heads about tactics and caution and forward planning. He’d easily guessed from the pseudonyms who several of them were. It was the group that always sat together at the front and always spent more time sighing and giggling than ever apparently learning anything.

He was not a man to be easily shocked, but the comments had left him speechless:

- hot hot HOT!!!!

- he can command me any time!

- OMG! did you hear him talk about the Ngultor today. My panties were melting!

- uff uff uff -- didn’t hear a word -- ovaries too busy exploding

- he said something? I was too busy gazing at those BLUE eyes and melting into happy puddle of goo

- how can grey hair and lines be SO FUCKING SEXY?!

- so smoking hawt

- and do those uniform pants fit well or what! check out THE BULGE!

Chris had backed away from the site very rapidly and immediately gone to order several pairs of less tightly tailored uniform pants. There was no way he was letting that pack of female predators corner him alone for six whole hours. He’d fought off Klingons, Romulans, even dissident humans... but some fights a man needed to know to avoid.

1350 credits. 1400. 1450. 1500. 1550. 1600. Chris caught Stephen’s eye and made a kill gesture with his hand. He wasn’t short of money but this was getting too rich even for him. Moving back to Earth had proved to be expensive and on top of that he was helping his parents to keep the ranch going while lending a hand to his sister, burdened with three kids and the debts left by a ne’er-do-well husband. He’d have to tough it out with the ravenous horde of fangirl cadets. He’d survived imprisonment by both the Ngultor and the Talosians. How much worse could it be?

Things seemed to have ground to a halt at 1600 credits. The MC was flirting with the lead spokesperson for the cabal, a perky brunette who Chris now recalled had never said anything coherent in his class but had seemed to spend a lot of time staring at his crotch. He vowed that he would be teaching from behind his desk for ever after.

“Going at 1600 for this fine figure of a captain. A girl’s wet dream come true!” The MC smirked at the brunette who tittered and gave Chris a little wave. How he was ever going to grade her papers with impartiality after this he did not know. “Going once... going twice....”

“2000 credits.”

A deep masculine voice spoke out firmly from the back of the room. An excited whisper swept through the room. Branch Admiral Philip Boyce, Surgeon-General. Chris sagged with relief. He’d not seen Phil for nearly ten years now. The man had served as his CMO on his first and second tours, before going on to greater things. They’d been colleagues and friends, sharing many adventures together. But neither had been the type to try to keep in touch once their careers moved in different directions, both ultimately wedded to the job.

Chris glanced over at the MC, desperate for the man to get it over with. But he was trying to encourage the women to have one more go and they were whispering frantically between themselves. “2100 credits,” called out the brunette eventually.

Chris gazed despairingly at Boyce, who was now working his way down the side of the crowded room. The man had aged since Chris last saw him, but damn - he’d aged well. He’d always been gorgeous. If Doctor Boyce hadn’t turned up with CMO papers in his hand, Chris would have taken him to bed the very first time he’d met him. Thick dark hair just beginning to grey at the temples. A firmly angled jaw. Piercing blue eyes. And a desert-dry humor that overlay the absolute authority with which he ran his medbay. It had been enough to make Chris seriously rethink his policy of never sleeping with his crew. But not enough to make him break it.

In the end his life was all about his ship and her crew. So he had assuaged the itch he’d felt every time he was in the company of his CMO by flirting outrageously with him while sleeping with every attractive ambassador, dignitary, or alien potentate that come his way and seemed willing. An amazing number of them had been willing. Thick honey-blond curls that he had allowed to grow beyond regulation length the minute he got away from Earth, combined with a shit-eating grin, a wicked sense of humor, deep blue eyes and - oh yes - being in charge of a fuck-off big ship, had served him well. He’d had fun out there in the black.

Hopefully Phil would remember some of the good times they’d had together and get him out of this mess. Boyce
