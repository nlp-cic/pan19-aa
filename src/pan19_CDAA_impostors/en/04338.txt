, sir.” Sheppard said.

“I want you to think of where we are in the galaxy.” McKay said.

Sheppard thought it up, and a holographic map of the galaxy appeared above him.

“Amazing. He’s a natural!” McKay said in amazement.

“Yeah, that’s great. Now get up.” O’Neil ordered.



Later that day



“Weir, I’ve thought it over. The power Lantea offers is too good to pass up. Your mission has been cleared. Say your goodbyes, though.” O’Neil said. “This is clearly a one way trip.”

“We know. I have one last request, though.” Weir said.

“Go ahead.” O’Neil said.

“We want Sheppard to come with us.” Weir said.

“Well, that’s between you and him. Ask him.” O’Neil said.

“I already did.” Weir said. “He agreed.”

“Fine by me. Just be warned, he disobeyed orders before and got lucky. He’s your problem.” O’Neil said.



2 days later





Cheyenne Mountain USAF Base.



“ZPM installed. Dialing gate.” A voice announced over the loudspeaker.

The portal began to spin, with the chevrons lighting up as it went. A burst of unstable energy came from the portal before sucking back in.

“Alright, we’ll go first, you follow-” A soldier started.

“No.” Weir interrupted. “If we go, we all go.”

The soldier nodded and everyone stepped through the portal.

After 10 minutes, they reappeared inside the city. The portal let out in a large anteroom with an overview platform. The stairs ahead of them lit up at their presence, and computers untouched for 10,000 years were awoken.

“Okay, everyone’s through. I sent a little housewarming gift along.” O’Neil said over the radio. Just then, a single unopened bottle of champagne rolled through the portal. Attached was a note that read “Welcome to Lantea. -General O’Neil”.

“Rodney, can you get these computers going?” Weir asked.

“Yeah, let me hook up to one.” McKay said.

“Split up, keep in touch.” Weir said as she walked up to an office area.

Beckett went to find the infirmary area, with a team of doctors carrying his luggage. Beckett had a habit of being over prepared.

“Dr. Weir? It’s Dr. Zelenka. You have to come see this.” Zelenka said over the radio.

“There’s a lot of things I have to see!” Weir said excitedly.

Meanwhile, Sheppard had followed the soldiers and found a hologram recorder.

“Hey, what’s this?” Sheppard asked.

“Some sort of recorder.” A soldier said.

He pressed a button and a human looking woman appeared and began speaking.

“If you are hearing this, we have lost the war against the Wraith.” The woman said. “We have migrated to Earth to hide. This ship is all that remains of the Lantean. When the war started, our shield kept them away. But soon they overpowered it. We had to sink this city-ship to the bottom of the ocean.”

“Is there a window around here?” Sheppard asked. A soldier noticed one in the main room and they gazed out of it. Sure enough, the ship was underwater.

McKay rushed behind them with his tablet.

“Did you guys activate a hologram?” He asked.

“Yeah. Why?” Sheppard said.

“Turn it off. Turn it off right now!” McKay yelled.

“Why?” Sheppard asked him, genuinely confused.

“Because if you don’t, we’ll all drown.” McKay explained. “The ZPMs that power the shields should have lasted another thousand years, but our arrival changed that. I’ve shut down all nonessential systems but we have to be careful.”

Immediately after he stopped talking, they felt an earthquake. They looked out and saw bodies float out of a building.

“The shield is already failing. That section is flooded. Everyone back to the control room now!” McKay said.

After everyone got back, McKay explained the situation.

“I won’t lie to you. We’re screwed. By my count...we have a little less than 5 hours.” McKay said. “Any ideas?”

“I found some Ancient space shuttles.” Zelenka suggested. “Maybe we could escape that way.”

“Yeah, because space shuttles work perfectly at the bottom of the ocean.” McKay said sarcastically.

“What if we used the portal?” Sheppard suggested.

“We can’t dial Earth!” McKay yelled.

“Could we dial somewhere closer? Somewhere in this galaxy?” Sheppard said.

“We could do that. I’m gonna dial a planet, get a team ready.” McKay said. “We have about four hours left.”

McKay quickly skimmed through the ship’s database before settling on a random address. The device spun like on Earth, and a burst of energy released and
