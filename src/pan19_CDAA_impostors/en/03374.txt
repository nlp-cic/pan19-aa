became wet and he nodded, returning the hug, "I'll leave you be."

When Dean was out of the room, he wiped his eyes.

He saw Benny standing there, he walked up to him.

"You okay brotha?"

Dean huffed a sad laugh, "You know, that was the guy that found my dogs..."

Benny looked surprised, "Really?"

Dean nodded, "I gave him my number and told him to call me if he ever needs anything. I-I think I should go home though."

Benny nodded, "Ya, I'll cover for you. Go home to your family."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dean got home around dinner time. Cas was in the kitchen, Riley in a height chair, Lacey by her feet.

Dean walked over and kissed Riley's head, making her squeal and Lacey bark.

Cas turned around, wondering what was going on.

Dean was standing behind him.

"Dean? What're you doing home so early?"

Dean walked over to him and wrapped himself around him.

Cas wrapped his arms around Dean and pulled Dean into his person, "What's going on?"

He heard Dean sniffle and he became more concerned.

"Dean?"

Dean huffed a sad laugh against Cas's chest, "You know, I saw the guy who found our dogs again..."

"When, how- Oh... What happened?"

Dean sniffled, "Parents and little brother were in a car crash... Parents didn't make it."

Cas's face fell, "Oh baby..."

"I-I almost made us lose the kid... Benny had to snap me out of it."

Dean could feel Cas's breath on his head, "Ya but you saved him."

"But I almost didn't."

Cas pulled back, "But you did."

"I gave them my number, told them to call if they ever needed anything..."

Cas smiled, leaning down and kissing him lightly, "That was nice."

Dean nodded, "Pete and his sister are both in college... They're going to need help."

Cas agreed, "Well, luckily, you are such a nice person."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It was about two weeks later before Dean heard from Pete.

"Hello?"


"...Uh, Dean?"


"This is him-Lacey stop, leave her alone. Sorry. Who is this?"


"Pete. I shouldn't have called, you're busy..."


Dean stopped playing with Riley and sat her against his torso, waving Lacey away, "No, it's okay. Really. How are you and Sarah? How's Caleb?"


"We're good. Caleb is back to his silly self, I hadn't had the heart to tell him yet..."


Dean frowned and adjusted Riley, "I'm sorry. I really am. It's hard to explain something like that to a little kid."


"I, uhm, was wondering if you could do me a favor... I know you don't owe us anything, in fact I owe you my brothers life-"


Dean interrupted him, "What do ya need Pete? I can help to the best of my ability, that's why I gave you my number. I want to help."


"Well, me and Sarah have this college lecture thing that we need to go too and our usual babysitter can't work today..."


"I can watch Caleb for you guys."


"A-Are you sure? I can find someone else, I know you have your own kid, plus your brother-"


"It's okay, I can watch him. Him and Sam can play together. Sam would like that."


"Three kids is a lot to handle, are you sure?"


"Ya! If I need help, I can call my mate or someone."


"O-Okay. Thank you so much."


"No problem, my address is..."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the doorbell rang, Dean picked Riley up and walked over to the door.

Pete was standing behind it with the little boy that Dean had operated on, "Hi Caleb! Hey Pete."

Pete gave Dean a tired smile, he knew the feeling.

"So, uh my lecture is until seven, I'll be here around 7:30 to pick him up."

Dean nodded, "Sounds good."

Pete looked down to his brother, "Be good for Dean, he's doing us a favor."

The little boy nodded and hugged his brother.

Pete looked to Dean, "Thank you so much, I-I'll pay you for watching him."

Dean shook his head, "No, don't worry about it and I'm sure Caleb will be good."

Pete smiled then took off.

Dean lead Caleb inside, "Do you want to meet my little brother Caleb?"

"Sure!"

Dean smiled, "Oh, this is Riley, she's my daughter."

Caleb smiled at him and followed him to Sam's room, "Sammy?"

Sam looked up from his book, "Ya De?"
