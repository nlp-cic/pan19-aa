!"

 "What do they have that you don't?"

 "Friendship."

 "Cee's friendship." Liam says. "Of course."

 "What about Clarity?" Haz asks, all but spitting her name.

 "She was trying to make Josh jealous, and it worked." Ni explains. "I was trying to make Cee jealous, and it failed."

 "Of course it did." Clara says. "I told you: Only friends."

 "That you did."

 "Then why?"

 "I just had a weird lot of hope."

 "It got you nowhere."

 "It got me somewhere."

 "Yeah. Further away."

 Ni nods.

 "One more thing."

 "What?"

 "You're not sleeping in here again."

 "Fine. Who will then?"

 "Anyone except you."

 "I will." I say.

 "Good idea, Lou." Haz says. "You'e the best one for her."

 "Why?"

 "She trusts you more than anyone else."

 Clara bites her lip.

 "I'm hurt, Cee." Jer says sarcastically.

 She grins. "Poor boy."

 I laugh. "It's getting late. You better head home, Jer."

 "Yeah." Jer says. "I'll come by on Sunday."

 "You're welcome anytime." Haz says.

 "Thanks, Harry."

 "Call me 'Haz'."

 Our jaws drop. Already?!

 "I take it that this is rare?" Jer asks.

 "Never happened before." Haz replies.

 "Well then..."

 "Hurt my sister again and you'll regret it."

 "Wouldn't dream of it."

 "Good."

 "Bye, Haz, Zee, Liam, Horan and Cee."

 "Bye!" we yell as he walks away.

 "I'm going." Ni says, walking out.

 "Are you going to Sam's?" I ask.

 "Li and I are." Zayn says.

 "We better go get ready." Liam mutters, dragging Zayn away.

 "I am but, I have to find Ni first." Haz vanishes.

 "Cee?" I ask. "Are you going?"

 "Should I?" Clara asks.

 "It'll help."

 "I'll go if you are going."

 "Why me?"

 "I just trust you so much easier."

 "I'm nobody special."

 "You must be."

 "Why do you say that?"

 "You're my friend and my brother's boyfriend."

 "Haz would have had others before me."

 "That's the thing, he didn't."

 "All those girls..."

 "He used them to try forget you."

 "Why?"

 "He was afraid, Lou. He still is."

 "When did this start?"

 Clara hands me a book. "Read it."

 "This is yours!" I protest.

 "Just read it. March 15."

 I open the book and begin to read.

March 15, 2008                 Something has changed. Harry is happier but, at the same time, he is afraid of something. He is happiest when he is around the lads, though it's mainly Louis that he is happy around. I have a faint idea and hope that it is real.                I am begining to think that Harry likes Louis, but is afraid of Louis rejecting him. I know Louis though, and he wouldn't reject Harry without a fucking good reason. I just hope that nothing bad comes of this.                   I can trust Louis with anything but, I am still hesitant to trust Louis with Harry's heart. I don't know if I can let them get much closer... If I can trust him, then Louis better treat him like an angel and not break his heart.

 "That's enough." Clara says, taking the book.

 "Three years?" I ask.

 "That's when I first began noticing it."

 "From what I read..."

 "It sounds like I was crushing on you."

 "Yeah."

 "Creepy right?"

 "You were."

 Clara blushes.

 "Fuck. You were!"

 Clara looks away.

 "You still are." I sigh.

 "I can't help it."

 "We're going out."

 "I'll go get ready."

 Liam pulls up at Sam's party and we get out of the car. It feels good to get out of our cramped positions and stretch. We only had Liam's car because Lou doesn't have a car and Haz's car was out of fuel, thanks to Ni taking it and going for a ride.

 That means that I had to sit on top of someone, and it wasn't going to be Ni. Haz was in front seat, Liam was driving, Zayn was curled up on his seat and Ni just wasn't an option. That meant that I had to sit on Louis, and boy was that awkward.

 "Stay with Lou." Haz says.

 "Don't do anything stupid." Zayn adds.

 "Lou, don't get drunk." Liam warns
