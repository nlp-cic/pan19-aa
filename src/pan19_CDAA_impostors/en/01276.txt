you, whispering, "We'll schedule a doctor's appointment and find out if the baby's mine." He lays his forehead against yours and you nod, lightly kissing his lips.

 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You are passed out on the car ride home, Dean had gotten his car from the impound and you went with him instead of Sam.

Dean put you to bed and went to bed himself, exhausted.

Dean woke up to your phone ringing. He groaned and leaned over you, grabbing your phone.

"Ya?"


'Dean?'


Dean sat up straighter, making sure you were still asleep. He got out of bed and went to the hall, quietly shutting the door. He looked at the time, 8am. Damn.

"Do you realize how fucking early you are calling? Why are you calling Mrs. L/N?"


'I-I wanted to talk to Y/N-'


"Well she is sleeping and I'm not waking her up, as if she would even want to talk to you."


'Dean- You must know how truly sorry we are-'


Dean scoffed, "A little too late. Listen, we have nothing to talk about so goodbye Mrs. L/N."

Dean hung up and went back in the room, you were still sound asleep. He crawled back in bed with you and kissed your head, snuggling up to you and smiling when you moved closer to his warmth.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the next time Dean woke up you weren't in bed, he sat up and listened.

He could hear you in the bathroom, puking.

He sighed and stood up, going to the bathroom door. He stepped into the room and went to you, holding your hair while sitting on the bathtub, thumb rubbing your neck.

"'Mma make a doctors appointment today to go and find out who the baby is."

You nodded and wiped your mouth, Dean left you to make the appointment.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you were in the doctors office you started twitching, you were nervous.

"Y/N?"

You looked up and stood, going to the nurse, Dean behind you.

The nurse sat you down on the table, "Your physician will be with you shortly."

You nodded and she left. You fidgeted with your fingers, Dean took your hand in his.

"It'll be alright baby, no matter what, I'll be here."

Your doctor walked, "Hello! How are you two today? What is it that you are here for?"

You paled, Dean squeezed your hand and replied.

"Find out if the baby is mine."

You saw the doctor stop for a moment but as he did he started moving again.

"Alright, I will need to take some samples from you two, you do know that there is a chance of a miscarriage with taking one before the baby is born right?"

You looked at Dean and he nodded, he turned back to the doctor, "It's fine. We really need to know..."

The doctor nodded and proceeded to get the procedure ready.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you had done the procedure you and Dean waited anxiously for the answer that could make you happy or break your heart.

The doctor turned to you with his clipboard, "You would like to know the father?"

You and Dean both nodded.

"Well the father is-"



To be continued...



"Dean... You are not the father."

Yours and Deans world crashed down. Dean looked at you with sadness, your eyes welled with tears.

"Dean, I'm-"

Dean kissed you lightly, "It's okay baby, I still love you and our baby."

You cried into your hands, Dean not knowing how he could possibly make you feel better.

Your doctor's face scrunched, "Oh I'm sorry, I read that wrong. The test is showing that the child has some of both DNA from you and Dean."

Your head snapped to your doctor, "S-So you're are saying-?"

Your doctor nodded, "Yes, he or she is Dean's baby too." He smiled at you.

You started crying hard, your baby will be okay and Dean is its daddy. You threw yourself around Dean who was still shocked.

Dean slowly wrapped his arms around you, putting his face into your neck where you could feel him crying. You gave a watery laugh.

"You are at the point in pregnancy where you can find out the gender, if you want."

You and Dean both nodded and the doctor set you and the machine up.

He found your baby and pointed at a spot, "It's a girl! Congratulations."

He printed photos and gave you them, leaving you two.

"Dean, we're having a baby girl. She's yours." You rubbed your hand down your stomach after cleaning it off. You were so happy.

Dean kissed you again and again, "I'm so lucky to have you two." He leaned down to your stomach, "Daddy loves you baby girl." You smiled, she was totally going to
