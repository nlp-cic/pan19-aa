only complicated by the sheer size of his databases. The trail of death and destruction following the flagship of the fleet makes his query easier, matching the hits of locations that they had been but had left intact took only moments. There was only one hit.


Query: Altern11a


“Take me back home, love,” she whispers, voice lowered enough to give his audio feeds trouble catching the words. Whether it is on purpose or simply a part of an act played out by a troll oblivious to the fact that her conversation’s aural glands have long ago eroded he doesn’t know. He doesn’t really want to, but he logs the question in his status report regardless. She’ll glance over it later, possibly be amused, probably not paying enough attention to be even that.

Query: why n0w why d0 y0u need t0 g0 back


Alternia is home to beautiful memories, to hopes and dreams and everything the empress t0uches ends in flames or worse. Five new error report alerts appear on his main feed and he puts them in the folder labeled fear. Fear124154323, Fear124154324, Fear124154325, Fear124154326, Fear124154327. Fear is not something he encounters often, not since shortly after being enfolded in his private hell of networking biomass. Anger, hatred, bitterness, those are common to him. Sometimes there is pity, when he realises no one knows the empress like he does, but those thoughts never do anything but make him hate her even more. There is no need for fear, not when one has so little to lose as he does.

But Alternia is sacred, the one place he can’t stand to see in flames and he fears -Fear124154328, Fear124154329, Fear124154330- that the sanity, the consciousness he’s managed to hold on to by telling himself that as long as he lives to remember the Signless’ dreams she will never succeed in entirely eradicating them, will evaporate. To become just a machine, to lose his opinions and his dreams -Fear124154331, Fear124154332- just like he’s already lost his free will and his senses makes him dread the knowledge that -Fear124154333- he might be living on forever even more than he already did.

She strokes his hair, mindful not to touch his goggles or the tentacle pugged into his spinal chord. It must be terribly greasy, he thinks. He hasn’t bathed in centuries. :3472 sweeps 3 per11gees 24 days 13 h0urs 34 m11nutes 12 sec0nds: his archives supply, and he’s not sure whether it’s the physical grossness implied or the knowledge that that is the amount of time he’s spent here, in the helmsblock that makes the ‘uncomfortable’ error reports stack up. “There is something wrong, love. Something on Alternia is terribly wrong and none of those horribly lazy peasants serving me knows why our home planet has vanished from the radar. You’ll be a dear and get me there, won’t you?”

Then something new happens. After placing another tender kiss on his forehead, and then another on his lips -anger148201422262, anger148201422263, anger148201422264- she turns to the display and actually reads his comment, sneering condescendingly. “They are incompetent fools darling, but I already knew that. And please stop using such uncouth vocabulary.”

Once again she merely laughs as if he said something hilarious before swatting his cheek softly. He doesn’t feel a thing. “Don’t be silly love. Who would even consider turning me down? Now then, be a dear and tell me how long it takes until we reach home.”
