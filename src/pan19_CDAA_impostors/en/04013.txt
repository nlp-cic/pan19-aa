he was done he turned around, handing you your towel. You wrapped it around yourself, not wanting to get dressed. Dean sensed this and picked up your clothes, grabbing your hand, leading you to your bed.

You both sat down, Dean looking over your injuries, noting none of them needed stitches but there were nasty bruises that will hurt like a bitch.

‘I’ll uh, just let you get dressed.” Dean got up, about to leave, but you grabbed his hand, “Thank you Dean.”

Dean smiled, “Anything for you sweetheart, I only wished I did something earlier, I knew he wasn’t good for you. You deserve the world Y/N.” Dean squeezed your hand and kissed you on the cheek, pulling away blushing. He quickly left. You got dressed and went to sleep, snuggling into the covers.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next morning you walked into the kitchen to find the brother’s sitting at the table, talking and drinking coffee.

They both looked up as you walked in, going over to the cabinet to get cereal for yourself.

Sam was the first to speak, “How are you Y/N?”

“I’m good Sam.”

Dean was the next to speak. “Are you sure?”

“Positive.” You sat down with your cereal, digging in.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the afternoon you were lounging in your room when there was a knock at the door. You yelled for them to come in; Dean walked in.

“Y/N. Can we talk?”

“Of course Dean, what’s on your mind?” Dean looked nervous.

“You’re not okay. I can tell when you’re lying. Y/N, talk to me.”

“De. I can’t.”

“Yes you can sweetheart.”

“Alex. He- I thought he loved me. He was amazing at first. But things went bad. He started drinking more; was angry, bitter. When he first hit me I fought back, that just made it worse. It was easier to just let him do it. Then that last time he- he was trying to get me to have sex with him, when I refused and pushed him off he had beat me; saying horrible shit. I guess I’m just not good enough for anyone. Oh well.”

“Y/N you’re perfect. That’s why I fell in love with you.” Shit. He wasn’t supposed to say that.

“Wait what did you just say?”

“Nothing Y/N!”

“Dean.”

“Now I really hope I don’t fuck this up,” You heard Dean whisper to himself, he stepped toward you. “Fuck wha-” You were cut off by Dean’s lips crashing into yours. You were shocked.

When he pulled back for air he looked down, rubbing his hands against his thighs; “Y/N; I’ve liked you for a long time. Hell, it’s more than that. I love you. I love you so god damn much. Since we were kids; I just always thought you deserved the best and I know that is not me but I can’t stand you feeling low, blaming yourself when you are fucking perfect.” Dean pulled you into his arms kissing your head. You looked up at him, kissing him on the lips, feeling safe, content.

“Does this mean I’m your girlfriend?”

Dean chuckled, “Only if you want to be beautiful.” “I do.”

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you and Dean went to the grocery store, you needed to stock up on more food; the refrigerator was almost completely bare.

You were in the candy isle picking out candy that you wanted and knew the boys would want. You felt a hand land on your shoulder, you turn thinking its Dean, “Baby what kind of ca-“ You don’t get to finish because your mouth is covered with a hand, you’re being dragged out of the store, around to the side where you’re slammed up against the wall; hand on throat.

“You got a new boyfriend already Y/N? I knew you were a slut. You’re probably dating fucking Dean aren’t you? Well, you’re mine.”

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When Dean couldn’t find you in the store he got worried, you also weren’t picking up your phone. He asked people, seeing if any seen where you went. One of them told him that they saw you with a guy, he dragged you out. He walked out of the store and heard you scream. Dean ran towards where the scream was and turned the corner to find Alex pinning you to the wall, his nails digging into your arms; screaming.

Dean stormed over to you, grabbing Alex off, throwing him away from you. Dean stood in between you and Alex growling, “Stay the fuck away from her, from all of us. She isn’t yours.”

Alex glared at Dean, “Oh Dean how wrong you are.
