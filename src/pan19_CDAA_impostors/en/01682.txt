a disappointment.-----

You collapse the entrance to the ruins under a mountain of snow. 

Miraculously enough, the child doesn’t appear. You talk. A lot.

At some point, you ran into Alphys and talk and talk and talk.

and then you talk to her about… things.

You bring her to your cave (what cave?) the one where you write down everything. Every permutation. 

She sees something there, something in certain gibberish that you don’t understand.

You are drawn out of yourself and into the sweet sweet world of science.

It’s soothing. You’re part of something else. It’s months Years.

Before the next time begins, and you solve so many things that were plaguing you.

-----

you’re trapped in a movie and you’re not even the main character you’re a side character a forgettable maverick with a fan following and someone is giving you a second third fourth fifth sixth chance.

You collapse the mountain. The timeline is not consumed.

You present last time’s research to Alphys as proof of concept.

She thinks she knows what is happening.

She tells you

You forget what happens next, and she is dead in front of you and you can do nothing but hate her.

-----

you have to be more careful. you’re sure that soon, the child will grow tired of being trapped in the ruins. You’re certain you’ve only won this much time because it is something new

You tell alphys you know everything.

Everything.

You tell Alphys everything you know.

Tell everything Alphys know you. you.

Everything Alphys tells you, you know.

You know why you’re trapped here. It’s Alphyss she did it. She broke what was supposed to be unbreakable.

She gave a creature determination.

It’s so funny that you can’t laugh. You’ve lived years like this, and your voice is so scratchy.

You shake.-----

You take your first shot of determination.

-----

You are shattered. A thousand people know you and know nothing of you and don’t know you and you have been forgotten. The child freely walks and kills.

You are beyond them. You have fallen into your own project.

You are dead.

you talk with hands

 

-----

You distantly remember a promise that someone said to you once.

That you should protect the child.

You’re alive.

----It’s different now. You can’t tell why, you can’t remember, but you did something and the world changed… but you can’t remember, and alphyss won’t tell you, no matter what you do

-----

You do nothing this time. You don’t interfere. Your brother is reduced to powder. Undyne is reduced to powder. Toriel is reduced to powder. The land is reduced to powder.

It’s funny. In the final corridor, the last time it matters, ever. 

The child kills you.

And despite it being the first time you die.

you’re not sure when it wasthe last timeyou lived

-----

you give up

-----

 

you’re making too many snowmen

-----

the cave is too big but it can’t fill your soul

-----

the child laughs and you are friends with hands around each other’s necks

-----

you cannot remember anything other than these loops. You have a distant feeling that there was something before this, but all you remember is that you have a brother.

-----

and you love him a lot

you still can’t make a snowman that looks like you

you realize you can, and that the blob on the ground is you

a failure

it’s rude to talk about someone while they’re listening

You gave up.


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

The sun is an immense eternal explosion of energy cascading across the landscape in a defiant scream to the elder grasp of time.

It's funny.

The times fixed themselves when you removed yourself from the equation. 

You're useless. Just like you knew you were. You only existed to talk to the main character a few times, foreshadow information that he already knew, in some infernal plot where you must repeat the same words as you would. Except you couldn't know that from the start.

It had probably taken you years to get an absolutely perfect run of it. Years of careful calculations. You can't remember any of them. You feel like there's a crack in your skull where all the sun shines out, spilling into the grassy fields at the bottom of mount Ebbot.

You haven't moved in an hour. It's alright. None of the others have moved either. There's a cool breeze drifting off of the meadow, and you can smell for the first time in all probability centuries, drifting pollen and the sharp tang of acrid smoke, coal oil or some other thing you read about once in a book someone threw into the garbage. Asgore stares blankly at what had
