A month of ongoing matches later and Marinette had yet to click with any of the men she met. Sure, a few of them could have been possible candidates, but there was always the wavering suspicion that, no matter what, would not go away. Even if the site had not ended up with its original use, she found herself growing more comfortable on the advice forums; especially in the design portions.

From lingerie to role playing costumes to specific BDSM preferences, Marinette’s username was the go-to for all things wearable. With the collaboration of a few online shops, she was able to submit commissions; which, in turn, earned her a little extra pocket cash. It was quite surprising to discover the lack of garments for certain individuals. One would think in this day and age that the internet would be filled with all sorts of products, but each person had the same complaint: it’s not tailored correctly. Perhaps she could remedy that issue when she had the experience and money to create her own boutique.

Speaking of fashion…

The chime of her phone’s email notification was boisterous against the empty walls of the Grand Magie building. With the lead designers presenting their summer collection mock-ups, the interns and assistance were left to their own devices until the critic was over. Marinette wondered why she needed to be present today if she and the others could not enter the show room. There were quite literally a million other things she could be doing instead of sitting behind her desk and waiting for the day to end, but alas, it was not her place to question the supervisors. At least it was easy money.

Not even bothering to pretend she was working, she pulled her phone from her pocket only to see a message from the site waiting for her. At this point, she could narrow it down to one of two things. Either the person was looking for sexy fashion advice or they were a match sending dick pics. This is what became of her search efforts, and frankly, she thought she had seen just about every pick-up line, cheesy intro, and poorly played attempt at befriending that only desperate men thought was normal. However, to her surprise, the person was none of the above.

Confusion was an understatement.

She wrote that article nearly two weeks ago after reading a rather terrible analysis of sexual relationships by the username MischiefVolpina. It was merely an angry retort to fix the common misconceptions that people usually place on people who only seek certain benefits from their partners. However, now her curiosity was peaked. With her current predicament as it is, she felt she would be biased towards the subject matter, but for someone to notice the abundance of facts and nonexistent opinions, it certainly stirred a few questions of her own.

Taking a leap of faith, she opened her messenger to reply.

There, she thought, If he’s going to be elegant with his wording, then so am I.

His reply was instantaneous to the point that it left Marinette dumbstruck. God, she really hoped he wasn’t some jokster trying to get inside her head like the stalker she had to deal with her first week. Glancing around the office to make sure she was alone, the designer glued her nose to her phone to get some answers.

For the first time since he set foot in the States nine years prior, Adrien Agreste had a skip in his step and a smile on his face that he could not explain. When he arrived, he thought this would be the start of a new life, one where he and his father could patch the gap that had torn between them; however, with the new sister companies erected in both New York and California, Gabriel Agreste had little to no free time for his only son. Thus began his awkward, young adult years traveling back and forth between the two states for photo shoots and short visitations with his father.

But today was his last day.

It had been a year since the Agreste men came to an understanding deal that would finally determine Adrien’s future. After one last gruesome fashion tour that all but murdered the young man, he was ready to present his answer to his father. Months of contemplation and planning lead to that very moment, and frankly, he could not be happier with his decision(and he would shyly admit that his conversation with Coccinelle helped tremendously with his doubts). Although, when thinking back to the chat, he realized he had projected his own nervousness on to her, but judging by her reaction, she too needed a little boost. And to prove his point for both their sake, he was going to practice what he preached.

With one more deep, calming breath, Adrien entered the dining
