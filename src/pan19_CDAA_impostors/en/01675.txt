by early morning, looking to explain, and been taken to the room by Matsumae, or maybe Mirumo. Tsukiyama's face won't show any kind of sadness when they sit at the table for breakfast. And Kaneki won't say he's sorry. He turns on the bed, his eyes caught in things strewn across the floor, the bed. Papers. A bottle of water. A dark suit—not his. Tsukiyama must use this room himself, Kaneki wouldn't put it past him. Would explain why it's closed to other guests. He turns once more, and then again, before he rises, loses balance when he's on his feet, inside black socks. Tucked neatly in the drawers of the bureau—commode says Tsukiyama—he finds clothes and underwear that look too small, too muted, too earthy to belong to Tsukiyama. Kaneki's size. They smell clean and he sneers at the thought of Tsukiyama buying these for him, washing them, setting them carefully inside the drawers of this room, Kaneki's room, with his own hands. Maybe he's wrong, so he changes into them. The clothes he slept on—foreign, someone else's, too drunk—carry the stench from the memories he can't see clearly, they don't smell of her, even. The bedside table clock switches into eleven thirty two and he feels he's late even though he's made no appointment, not for today at least.

People he doesn't know are at his door, looking him in the eye. He smiles, scratches the back of his head, acknowledges the way they stare.
-Can I help you?, he asks. Doesn't hurt to help the guests.
-Maman, the shorter one says, are you okay?
-M-Maman?, he sounds dumb, his voice echoes through the halls, hangs from the windows, seeps outside. There hasn't been an earthquake in years but there are cracks at the middle and his words slip inside.
-Haise, is something the matter? He looks at the other one, can't place her. Maybe she's at the table with his mother.
-You must be mistaken, he says, I'm sorry. Then the taller one opens her eyes wide and bows.
-I'm sorry, she says, hurriedly. The shorter one is confused, she asks what's happening, and is ignored.
-We are here on official police business. May I ask your name?
Kaneki hesitates before he says his name, carefully, and bows. The shorter one mouths the name as if she's heard it before, as if it brings memories, he catches her.
-Excuse us, Mr Kaneki, the taller one says, Agent Yonebayashi and I made a mistake. We'll be on our way now. And she pulls on the arm of the shorter one, who stutters around words of confusion, and Maman, and being dragged away. He stares until he finds they meet with another officer he doesn't know at the end of the hall then loses sight of them.

Tsukiyama isn't at the table when he reaches the breakfast room. In a corner Chie snaps a picture of him so he waves at her, smiles, and is unable to recognise the look on her face. She comes to him confidently, snaps a picture of his face up close.
-Chie, he says, good morning.
-Good morning, Kaneki, she replies, and as if she guessed she offers, Tsukiyama should be here soon. He's been expecting you.
He laughs.
-He's been waiting for a while, I guess.
She snaps a picture of his hands.
-Yes.
He finally takes a seat at the table and Chie leaves silently, like a little mouse. After some minutes Tsukiyama stumbles into the room almost frantically. When Kaneki looks up he catches what can only be desperation on Tsukiyama's face and feels himself almost choke, clenching his fists. Tsukiyama looks different from the day before, almost more beautiful if possible, taller perhaps, slimmer. He's different and the way his eyes meet his and shine hopeful and fearful and dyed with lonely sadness, the one Kaneki knows takes experience to recognise, years to set so deep around someone, makes Kaneki look away. Even when Tsukiyama's sitting in front of him at the table, holding Kaneki's left hand on both of his, laughing too loudly, anxiously, Kaneki's eyes are caught on the edge of the table, the edge of the bridge, the edge of the shoes of the boy that keeps him from jumping, then threatens to push him, the edge on Tsukiyama's voice when he did these things, and the one now.
-Kaneki, he says. It's laughter and trepidation, his hands shake and Kaneki has to keep himself from holding onto one of them with his left. He was so sure none of this would show on his face
