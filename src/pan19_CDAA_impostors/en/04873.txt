dust, thus making her cough, but Nico soon realized the actual reason behind this and worried about her health.

One day, between classes, Nico approached Nozomi in a smooth way to leave her a note without anyone else noticing. Of course, Nico didn’t have any image to keep at school; she just loved to pretend she was the Japanese equivalent to an American cheerleader, so she couldn't be seen talking to a random student as her equal.

«Stay at the end of the last class of the day», the note said, «I want to talk with you». Nozomi didn’t understand what was going on, but she was curious about that lonely yet haughty person, so she of course stayed. It was also a good chance to make her second friend ever, now her family was totally established in Tokyo and she wasn't going anywhere anymore.

At the end of the day, Nozomi packed her things in the schoolbag, but she stayed. Once eveyone else left the classroom, Nico approached her. Nozomi thought she seemed like a totally different person when no one else was around.

–Hey, you are doing no good to your body, lad! –Nico said– What do you think your body is? You have to take care of yourself!

–What?

Nozomi was astonished. Nico’s voice now felt a lot more soft and warm, like a mother talking to her children. But there was a concrete question which had to be answered before anything else.

–What am I doing wrong? –Nozomi asked– I don’t get it.

–You can’t force your throat to sound high-pitched, not like that. At this rate, you will get throat cancer before you reach 20, you know!?

–I’ve been hoarse often during middle school, Nico. I know I'm damaging my body, but what else can I do?

Everyone in their class knew Nico’s name, because most of her classmates looked down on her and dissed her. Nozomi wasn’t one of them, but she was well aware of what other people said when Nico missed school.In Nico’s head, nonetheless, Nozomi knew simply because there wasn’t any way she couldn’t. Nico was –according to herself– the most popular, beloved and respected student in all Otonokizaka.

–What do you mean?

–I don’t want anyone to know… –Nozomi coughed– what I actually sound like.

Nozomi’s voice was very deep for a girl, despite not being deep enough to be mistaken for a boy. She was just in the middle, like a boy who didn’t hit the puberty yet. Once Nozomi coughed, she couldn’t keep her high pitch any longer, she would just remain silent from that moment onwards. But it was Nico, the person who would become her new friend, so she decided to trust her.

–I see what you mean –Nico said in a pitiful voice.

At the time, Nico thought it was natural for Nozomi to wish a higher pitch, since her movements and speech were both so flirty. It she only had a higher pitch, she would be the perfect, flirty girl. Nonetheless, since perfection didn’t exist, her only option left was to fake it.

That's why Nico told her to stay in the first place.

–Well, Miss... Uhm... What was it, again?

–I never told you in the first place! –Nozomi laughed– It's Toujou. Nozomi Toujou, in fact, so just get rid of the «Miss» and call me Nozomi.

–Well, Nozomi, you are very lucky! Because you just happened to attract the attention of the wonderful, cute and lovely Nico Yazawa, who is going to spend some of her time teaching you to raise your pitch in a natural, non-harming way! You will even look as sweet as me once I’ve finished with you!

Of course she was lucky. She had prayed every day for years to have a higher pitch. The fact was – she never thought her wish would be granted in such a casual fashion. It was even funny, if you thought about it.

–Is there a way?

–Of course it is! I want to become a school idol, you know? So I know a few things about singing –she said, as she simulated holding a microphone near her mouth–, providing me a wide range of pitches to speak in.

–And why are you teaching me, if I can ask?

–Well, I felt pitiful for you.

–You looked more compassionate, if you ask me.

–What’s the difference?

–Pitiness is feeling you should help me out because it’s your duty, implying you look upon me. But compassion is fueled by affection, because you regret my situation and you wish better for me.

–Then I’m totally pitiful –Nico was, of course, lying–. Why would I regret about someone I know nothing about
