I look sad?

MaryM: I think you are. People who come here and are not maniacs need to talk to someone else, because they're lonely. And many lonely people are also sad people.

John221: So you're lonely and sad too?

MaryM: Maybe

John221: I like talking to you

John221: Typing, sorry

MaryM: I like typing to you, too. But I have to go now. Lesson

John221: Oh, yes, sure! Have a good lesson

MaryM: Will you be here tomorrow?

John221: Yes, if you wish

MaryM: I wish you'll be here

John221: Ok! See you tomorrow! Well, see you… in chat, obviously! Can I say 'see' in a chat?

MaryM: Goodbye, John!

*MaryM has disconnected*

John221: Goodbye!

John221: Oh, you're gone. Probably I should go too

John221: Who am I talking to?

John221: …typing….

John221: I suppose this could be called… stalking?

MaryM: Not properly. I'm consenting

John221: Oh Jesus you're here!

MaryM: Yes, I wanted to meet you earlier.

John221: By the way, I was thinking… we always meet near to your lessons… but maybe we could meet in another way?

MaryM: I'm not home before 3pm

John221: Oh no, I mean… meet… in real life

MaryM: Oh

John221: Sorry, it sounds creepy, we just talked 3 times, please, forgive me

MaryM: No… maybe it would be fine

John221: …but?

John221: Are you an old lady with a wooden leg? In this case… well, it would be fine anyway

MaryM: Ahah. I have not a wooden leg

John221: Neither a hook?

MaryM: No. But it would be nice

John221: I think it would fits you

John221: No no no I mean that I think everything would fits you, even a hook!

John221: so, if you have an eyepatch it's not a problem to me!

MaryM: Do you really want to meet me?

John221: Yes. Just to talk. This chat makes me feel a bit… spied. If you want too, of course

MaryM: Want to be spied?
