me to give Liam a quarter when we see him next.” 

“Otay, Daddy. I’m hungie.” 

“I’m hungie, too, Becks.” Louis nods. 

“Din.” Beck states. “Hazzy, you stay for din?” 

Fuck, just what Louis needs. More time to with Harry. More time for Louis to stare at him and lust after his beautiful lips and gorgeous, big hands. Fuck. That’s the worst idea of all time, Beckham. Jesus. No, what is Louis saying? He can be an adult. He can control himself, thank you very much. 

“Yeah, Hazzy, want to stay for dinner?”

Harry beams, but it quickly falls into a frown. “I’d love to, but my best mate has his first paid gig tonight and I promised him I would go.” 

“Gig?” Beck asks, confused at the word.

“He plays music, the guitar.”

“Daddy make musics.” Beck nods at Harry. Harry laughs and nods back. 

“Indeed he does. But, so does my mate Niall.”

“Nail?” 

Louis laughs at that. “Niall.” He corrects. 

“Nail.” Beckham says again. He glares at Louis, clearly refusing to believe he is wrong. Okay, Louis will let him win this round. 

“Yes, Nail.” Harry laughs. “I have to go see him. Otherwise, I would’ve stayed. Thank you for offering.” 

“No prob.” Beck shrugs. Louis snorts. 

“Really though, you watch my kid, the least I can do is feed you.” 

“Well, to be honest, I hear that you aren’t that great of a cook.” 

“Beckham Ignatius! Are you spreading lies about me!? Are you gossiping about your father?!”

Beckham giggles and Louis attacks him with tickles. 

“No, no. Daddy. No I pee. I pee!” Beckham shrieks. Louis stops immediately and sets him down, patting his bum as he runs off to the loo. It’s best to stop as soon as Beck says that. Louis has been peed on an unfortunate amount of times. 

“Thanks for offering.” Harry says again. 

“It’s no problem, Harry. You’ll just have to stay another night. That’s exciting for your friend, though. First paid! Where’s he playing?” 

“Queen’s Head.” Harry answers. 

“Huh. Not too shabby.” 

“Nah, it’s a pretty classy place.” Harry moves around the counter as he grabs for his bag and hat. Ugh, that fucking hat. It’s so dumb and ugly. Louis hates it, but somehow Harry looks good in it? It’s all very confusing. 

“It is. Your mate any good?”

“Phenomenal. But, I might just be a bit biased. Ya know, being his best mate and all.” 

“Only a bit.” Louis laughs. “But uh, maybe Li and I will have to come see him play some time.”

Harry’s face positively lights up at that. “Really!? Holy shit, Louis. That would, fuck, that would be amazing. Niall would honest to god shit his pants. I uh, I didn’t really know how big of a deal you were.”

“Not that big mate.” Louis laughs. 

Harry rolls his eyes at him. “Yeah you are. Niall freaked when I told him your full name. He’s a fan of you and Liam.”

“How cute.” Louis laughs. He usually doesn’t have fans, it’s usually his artists. 

“Niall’s the cutest.” Harry laughs. “But, seriously. I really should get going, mate.” 

“Beck! Wash your hands. Hazzy’s leaving.” 

There is a tumbling noise from the bathroom before Beck is bursting out of the door and into Harry’s arms. 

“Bye bye Hazzy! I see you soons!” 

“Very soons!” Harry giggles, placing a kiss on his cheek and squeezing him tight. “I’ll miss you.”

“I miss you more, Hazzy!”

Louis’ heart fucking throbs.

--
Louis didn’t know it was possible, but apparently it is, because it happened. Beck likes Harry more than Jen. Yeah, Louis is shocked, too. But, it’s true. Beckham is absolutely infatuated with him.

And Louis can’t blame him. Because he is, too. 

Louis’ a bit worried about it if he’s honest. 

Harry and Louis’ relationship really isn’t what it should be. It isn’t a regular nanny/parent or whatever relationship. It’s, more, like, flirty best mates? And that in itself is two problems. Number one, the flirty part and number two, the best mate part. It’s so, so, not right, but, Louis can’t help it. It’s just… they click, Louis and Harry. They just fucking click.
