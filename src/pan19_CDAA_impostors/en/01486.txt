likely gonna always feel bad about it.

"Awww Bucky, you teddy bear." Steve walked down the steps and gave Bucky a hug, his head barely touching Bucky's chin.


'AWGHDKJBEFIUERGEBHU FUCK ME! I'M GETTING HUGGED BY STEVE! I REPEATE, I AM GETTING HUGGED BY STEVE! AWQWWWWWWWWWHTHDREFGF YAAASASASASASASASASASASASASSSSSSSSSSSS!


Bucky hugged him back.

 


          (See the end of the chapter for  notes.)
          

TUESDAY 5:00PM So Steve and Bucky talked. Alone. Together. In Steve's house (Apt. but Bucky calls in a house anyway). With each other. They didn't talk about anything, just how each other was doing and then they ended up playing competitive Mario Kart which Bucky gets his ass kicked all the damn time but it's Steve so who cares. It made Bucky's alpha hormone levels the size of the chum bucket.

Bucky tried VERY hard not to get a large Philly Cheese Steak sized boner in front of Steve.

He succeeded. ---------------- TUESDAY 5:30PM Bucky's 'home'. Where the bed, appliances, bathroom, kitchen, and himself stayed. He was still excited and happy about Steve accepting his apology. He didn't really think that Steve would want to see him, let alone accept his apology. But then he thought. Steve always...accepts other peoples...apologies. FUCK!

He had to call Steve! Let him know that everyone's apologies that he accepts are fake! They aren't sincere! Except his of course.


'pick up, pick up, pick up!'


"Hey Bucky."

"Don't believe it! They're lying!"

"Buck wha -"

"My apologies are sincere! They're lying to you Steve! They only want to get in your pants!"

"Bucky, who’s 'they-"

"SINCERE!" Bucky hung up. In his baby's face. After 2 minutes and 30 seconds of realizing what he just did, Bucky slammed his face into his hands.

He needed to go to sleep. He's got another apology he needs to say tomorrow.

---------------------------------------------------------------------


WEDNESDAY 10AM


"Bucky why did Steve call me yesterday asking me if I knew anything about you're apologies being sincere and that 'they're' lying to him only to get inside his pants?"

"I had some type of breakdown."

"regarding apologies."

"yeah."

"Welcome to my life Barnes."

"I'm good."

"So you say." ------------ WEDNESDAY 12PM

'I'm coming over with Philly Cheese Steaks and fries.' --------------------------------------------- WEDNESDAY 1PM

"Steve. I'm sincerely sorry about that mental breakdown I had over the phone. and that I hung up in your face."

"It's okay."


'No it's not'


"Was it your PTSD?"

'No."

"Just you being weird."

"Yeah." Steve chuckled that's okay and he smiled.

Bucky wanted to knot the shit outta Steve and get him pregnant.

"You want to play the xbox this time?"

"Yes."

They ate and played Mortal Kombat X. Steve kicked his ass. He had no wins.

He did have a boner and red cheeks when he left though. -------------------------------------------------- THURSDAY 9AM


'Idk if you're awake yet but I made some chocolate and peanut butter rice krispy treats.'


Bucky ran out the house still in his pajama pants. ------------------------------------------ THURSDAY 9:30AM

"Why are you at my doorstep with only pajama pants on? Go home and get dressed, then come back."

Bucky ran back home. -------------------- THURSDAY 10:30AM

"I didn't think you would actually do it." Bucky didn't really get dressed. All he did was put on a t-shirt and some socks, but it was enough for Steve.

"I'll do anything for you Steve." He saw Steve blush and he knew he accidentally said that out loud.

"of course you would. who wouldn't?" little shit. loves him though.

Steve and Bucky had walked over to the couch and watched Maury and Jerry Springer cause there was nothing better to do than watch these hoes act up on TV. Until Steve went into the kitchen and brought out the krispy treats. Steve gave him his batch and set the other batches ("Jesus Steve, how many batches did you make?" "About a dozen give or take.") on the coffee table in front of Bucky and sat back down in the reclining chair. Bucky had barely ate his first treat before dropping it back into the baggie he had and dropping it on his spot.

"Steve, ohhhh mmmyyyyy goooooodddddd do you make the best sweets." Steve gave a small laughed and he shrieked when Bucky had wrapped his arms around Steve's waist and laid on him or at least he tried.

"Bucky! Get oof' me!" His words were muffled since Bucky's t-shirt and pecs were in his face.

"Nawp. You make the best desserts ever so you get the best love ever." He started rubbing his 'haven't shaved since a week ago' beard on Steve's neck
