you swore bloody revenge? Do I have to remind you that magic is still fucking illegal in Camelot? And do I have to remind you that after I saved your stupid arse again, you went and banished me??

And you have fourteen pairs of boots. You lost one pair in the Perilous Lands and the other one was eaten by that rat. See, it helps if someone is keeping track of these things!

And don't think I'll come home until you APOLOGIZE. Maybe you can ask Gwen how it's done.

Yours, seethingly,

Merlin

From his Majesty King Arthur of Camelot  to the rightfully banished Sorcerer Merlin at Ealdor, first day of the Blót Month:


Dear Merlin,

You want an apology now? How about this: I apologise that I gave you a place in the royal household, a place right by my side, even though you were the most abysmal servant that ever crossed my path. I apologise that I defied my father for you, and risked my life for you. I apologise that I trusted you above anyone. I was a fool.

Arthur

From Merlin at Ealdor to his Majesty King Arthur of Camelot, second week of Blót Month:


Dear Arthur,

that's not bloody fair. I risked my life for you, too. I risked my life every damn day living in Camelot, and you know why I did it? You know why I stayed? For you. Every damn thing I've done was for you, you horse fart! You don't know how often I wanted to tell you everything. But I was scared. Not for my life—well, not only for that. I was scared that you'd send me away, and I wouldn't be able to protect you any longer. I was scared that something would happen to you. I was scared that you'd hate me.

Do you really hate me now?

Yours, inadvertently,

Merlin

From his Majesty King Arthur of Camelot  to the Sorcerer Merlin at Ealdor, fourth week of the Blót Month:


Dear Merlin,

Do I hate you? Sometimes. You might not realize it, but I have people petitioning for mercy on your behalf every day. They've all stood before me. Gaius. Lancelot. Gwen. Gwaine. People from the town and the surrounding villages. People who claim that you helped them. And all I can think is that you trusted them when you never trusted me. That's what it comes down to, Merlin. I trusted you more than anyone else in my life. You trusted everyone else more than me.

Yours,

Arthur

From Merlin at Ealdor to his Majesty King Arthur of Camelot, first week before Yule:


I'm sorry.

Arthur, I'm sorry. Can you believe that at least? I'm honestly not sure what to say. I'm not sure if it will help to tell you that I never voluntarily shared my secret with anyone. They all found out by accident. Even Gaius. But more importantly, none of them were you. None of them had the power to destroy me. You still have that power, and not even by putting me on the pyre. You're special, Arthur. In so many more ways than you can imagine. Do you know that we share a destiny? At least that's what has been foretold according to the druids. Apparently we are two sides of the same coin. And maybe that means we're damned to never see eye to eye, but it also means that I'll always be with you, Arthur. I'll always have your back, even if you don't want me to.

I miss you Camelot, and I want to come home. Please. Please, let me come home.

Yours, ruefully,

Merlin

From his Majesty King Arthur of Camelot  to Merlin at Ealdor, second week before Yule:


Merlin,

I can't. You broke the law. I cannot break it, too. Not even for you.

I really wish you had told me, and that I had not been blindsided like this by your betrayal. That's what hurt the most. I don't know that everything would have been different if you had told me—I want to say that I would have taken it well, but we both know that's probably not true. But I believe I would have listened. Eventually. Given time, I would have found a way to deal with all the implications and consequences of who and what you are. Because there are consequences, even if you can't see that.

But most of all, I would have known you, Merlin. Instead of living with an illusion.

Yours,

Arthur

From Merlin at Ealdor to his Majesty King Arthur of Camelot, still second week before Yule:


Arthur,

you do know me. I'm still the same person I've always been, I haven't changed! I'm still your friend. 

I know that I should have told you, but I always thought
