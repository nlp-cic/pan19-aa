These four images were made to support specific action within the story.


Dean with Amara






In this image I enhanced the younger Amara's hand, played with the lighting
along with various very subtle textures.  I also enhanced Dean's eye.

Sam Vision






There are several screencap images used here.  All were manipulated for color and
texture as well as shape.  The blue flames are two images fused together and then
reshaped.  Then I layered in various opacities.


Sam with Impala






The Shattering of Baby -- take a look at the Walk-through (how it was done) in Chapter 4.

For the Sam image, after removing the background from the screencap I chose, I wounded
him in two small spots, 'painted' in some cool gray shading around him and called it done.
He was then overlayed in two different opacities to the 'shattered' Baby.

Dean End Shot






This is what I call The Martini Shot, which always comes at the very end.
Take a look at the Walk-through in Chapter 5 for this on how this image was created!

A walk-through on the composition of a single image!

Graphic Manipulation can be a lot more complex that some would imagine.
Sometimes it can be as simple as finding the right screen shot or image and running it through some filters for a desired effect.

Phot Manipulation can become a bit more complex by putting in a different background that fits what's needed better. But yet other manips,
to use the easy phrase, can become incredibly complex requiring both skill and patience. I thought I'd give you a walk through on two of the images for this story. Both were complex but in different ways.  I think I was successful and frozen-delight was delighted... pun intended!

And now.. on to the walk-through!





BABY IS ATTACKED!





When talking with Frozen_Delight about this story and what she might like for it in terms of graphics, one of the items she honed in on was smashing Baby.  It's a key scene in her ficlet.  I'd never done something like this before, but I told her I'd give it a try.  So... the goal for this image... smash Baby... it nearly broke my heart... but then I got into it.

This is the results and just a few of the many steps that I took to get there!




First... I needed Baby.  I have to tell you finding the right screen shot of this lovely lady took a bit of doing!
But after tons of images of Baby, I found the one I needed!





Next... I needed a field.  And what better field that the one where The Darkness was first unleashed?  It worked for me!
So... first I cropped out the bit of ground I wanted... distorted it and added a lot of dense smoke.



The smoke is comprised of many, many layers of browns, grays, blues and blacks.

Next... find some stock images of shattered and broken glass...







.

.

And now... comes the part where I give Baby some unneeded ventilation!
Make a hole... give it depth, shatter the edges and overlay radial breaks through the windshield.




This image is comprised of 4 different latyers.



.

.

Add tiny and medium shards of flying glass...then desaturate...




This image is comprised of another 5 layers.



.

.

Now, shatter the side windows and add more shards... and for a final touch add in some light
refractions...



Image comprised of 3 more layers, plus another layer of hand drawn in tiny light refractions.

Lay in the background... and... there ya go!

The next walk through I thought I'd share is of Dean.  It is really the end of Frozen-Delight's story.

And after reading it, I had this powerful image in my head of Dean.  Alone. I set out to try to bring that image to life.

So...I needed him kneeling in a field. There are a few images of Dean kneeling, but the one I wanted had a major flaw.  It was in a field, that was good.
It would, maybe, save me a bit of time, I thought... it didn't.

Baby was in the background... no biggie... just wiped her right out.

The flaw? Dean had just been beaten to a pulp by Sam before he jumped into the pit to be Lucifer's vessel!





So... I needed another Dean to manip a non-beaten face onto the kneeling Dean.  A new Dean head, in the right orientation.  I thought it would take me forever, but someone smiled at me... and I found one right away.





Next... I needed the field.  So... I grabbed the one of Dean and Amara when she tries to seduce him, and I worked it to death! Took her out, rebuilt the parts of the field that were now missing.  Got Dean in the field... perfect! But... you know what they say... don't count your chickens! I went back to the story in which the gifted frozen_delight specifically
