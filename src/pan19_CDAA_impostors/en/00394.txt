ride home."

"No need, thank you," Regina says grumpily. "I can walk."

"Fine ... Then I'll come with you," Emma insists.

"Well ... I guess it's my fate and I can't keep you from doing it, anyway, since you are the Sheriff and whom else would I be calling to come and help me?" Regina starts walking, her hands put into her pockets.

"Regina, wait a minute," Emma says while keeping Regina from walking any further. "I don't know why you don't want us to be in touch. I just know that somehow I have a feeling that I want to see you and be with you all the time. I can't explain it. I just know that you're the most beautiful woman I know... I guess it sounds weird, but I really feel attracted by you." She stares directly into the brunettes' eyes.

Regina takes a step back and sinks her head. "I know," she says, looking for the right words to say. "But this is simply ridiculous!" She starts walking again, and Emma follows. The two women walk all the way from Gold's shop to Reginas' house without saying a word to each other. Regina is relieved when they finally reach it.

"Well, here we are," she says to Emma, who is standing right next to her, in front of the entrance.

Emma smiles happily. She feels like a young boy who just brought his crush home after their first date and is now desperately waiting for their first kiss. Even a small kiss on the cheek would make her incredibly happy.

"Well ...", Emma says, sounding full of expectations. Maybe she would get the kiss she's longing for, or maybe Regina would even offer her to come inside.

"Go.", Regina says with a dominant sound in her voice.

Emmas' smile turns into a look of disappointment. "Alright," she says while turning her back on Regina and walking away from her house.

Regina steps inside the house and closes the door behind her. For a moment, she feels as if she had enjoyed Emma to come inside and spend some time with her. She wonders if it was really necessary to let her go away like this, without a word of good-bye. But in the next moment already, she thought to herself that it was better that way. Where could it possibly lead to have Emma, who obviously is very much in love with her due to the love charm, stay over for coffee?

Chapter III

Â 

Later that night, the bell rings at Reginas' place.

"Now, let me guess who this might be," Regina mumbles to herself while walking towards the door.

"Miss Swan! What a pleasant surprise!" Regina says with an ironic tone in her voice, hoping that Emma would understand that she is not welcome.

Emma smiles happily and hands a small box of sweets to Regina. "Hello, beautiful," she says. "You look wonderful!"

Regina looks down at herself and wonders what should be so wonderful about her look. She wears a grey skirt and a blue satin blouse, nothing special, just the usual look. "Did we have an appointment, Miss Swan?" she asks the blonde.

"No," Emma replies. "I just thought that you might like some company with Henry being asleep already."

"I did not ask for company," Regina says.

Emma sighs. "Don't tell me you're happy, being by yourself every night. Let me join you. We can watch a movie together, or cook something. What ever it is that you'd like to do, I'm ready to do it. So ... Can I come in? ... Please!" She tries to put the cutest look on her face she can possibly have, hoping that Regina would accept.

Regina thinks Emmas' strange wish over and over, really wanting to say "no", but then again she can't help but noticing the cute impression on Emmas' face. She looks up and down on the blonde woman, who somehow really looks different tonight. No sign of skinny jeans, a tight top or the red leather jacket that Regina dislikes so much. Emma is dressed in a lovely pink skirt, a pretty white blouse and a pink jacket, her hair tied up to a bun, which makes her almost look sexy.

Disappointed of herself to think of Emma as "sexy", Regina gets torn out of her thoughts. "Alright then, come in," she says to Emma. "But only for a short time, this will not be a sleep over!"

Emma is absolutely excited. Again, she feels like a teenage boy, staying at his crushs' house for the very first time. "So, what is it that you'd like to do tonight?" she asks Regina.

"Well, actually I'd just sit in the living room and watch some TV," Regina replies.

"Alright, then let's do that!" Emma says
