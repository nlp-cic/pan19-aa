the last stab.

„Is my cooking that bad, or where does she always go?” asked Derek at the dinner table. Laura never ate with them, but on the other hand, it had been just two days since he arrived. Or maybe it’s some kind of a new crazy diet...

„Hmm? Either way, now that you mention cooking, what did you say, when are you meeting Stiles?”

„On Saturday,” he answered suspiciously, waiting where will this question lead.

„Oh my God! I won’t eat proper food until Saturday? Why, God, why?” As she talked, she even threw her hands melodramatically in the air.

„Since when did you became so religious?”

„Since you began to cook. People find God in the darkest times, Der-bear,” there was something in her voice which made him think this is more than just a joke, but when he wanted to ask, he felt a sudden knot in his throat disabling him to speak.

„Are you ready for your date?”

„It’s not a date,” he told Laura for the hundredth time. She feasted her eyes on him with amusement laying on his bad like some big cat instead of a wolf. „Don’t you have anything better to do?”

She ignored him. „Are you sure you want to wear that for your first date?”

„It’s not a date.”

„Oh, don’t growl Der-bear. It doesn’t suit you... or actually it kind of does. Yeah, that  I’ll-kill-you-if-you-dare-to-say-one-more-word would definitely work on your date.”

„It’s not—” he was interrupted by Cora.

„Oh getting ready for the big date?” He kind of hated his sisters.

 „It is NOT a date.”

„Yeah, keep telling that to yourself, but choose another t-shirt. Do you only have hanley shirts?”

„Try the blue one,” assisted Laura, turning on her back now, not even bothering to act like she actually cares. He considered his options for a moment, a) he will change his shirt admitting it is a date, and that he cares, b) he won’t admit it, but will still never hear the ending of his ”date” and he will look bad in addition (on the date). He pulled off his shirt with a loud whine.

„The blue one?”  he asked his other sister’s opinion too, not making the same mistake .

„Perfect, can’t believe you only came this week, and you have a boyfriend before me,” said Cora throwing herself on the bed next to Laura.

„What happened to the date? How did he became my boyfrie— actually, I don’t even care,” he said pulling on the shirt, and shoving his wallet in his pocket. „Ice-cream in the fridge, oldmaids,” just to make sure, he even bowed his head a little in their direction.

Pulling up in front of the house he wondered if this was such a good idea. He doesn’t even know his age. „Oh god tell me he’s not underaged,” he prayed while he walked to the door. He barely touched the bell, and heared a loud thump and running soonly followed by a „Coming.”

„Heyy, Derek,” said the boy, barely stopping before falling out of the door he opened it with such hurry. He had to bit his lip to hide his smile from Stiles.

„Hey, does your butt hurt?”

„How did you—” he began, then laughed when herealized his instinctive butt rubbing motions. „I’m okay, but I think I need to get rid of my swivel chair. Third time this happened.”

„That’s not so bad.”

„Only on this week.”

„Yeah, you should get rid of it.”

The cooking went surprisingly easy. It didn’t take long for the various smells to fill the kitchen, and Derek’s rather sensitive nose- it smelled delicious.  Stiles made everything seem like it was a piece of cake, and Derek felt like a 5 year old baking with his, well, rather manly grandmother.

„What do you study?” asked Derek from Stiles while stirring the vegetables in a pan. They already clarified he’s an adult, so he could actually start a conversation without worrying.

„Nutrition,” after looking at Derek he continued. „I know,shocking.”

„No, actually it’s quite fitting.” That seemed to be the right answer- not like he didn’t mean it, but he liked the smile on Stiles’ face he helped put there.

„I lost my mother when I was young, and you know... my father being the sheriff didn’t help much with my fear of losing him too.I wanted to do something... but I’m not good with guns...I know it sound ridiculous, but this
