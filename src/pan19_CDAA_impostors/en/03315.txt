Hulk.  But every time Bruce has an uncontrolled Hulk-out it completely destroys his confidence.  If he runs away after this, it's on your head!" Tony stormed angrily.

"Wow, touchy.  Didn't know you had such a soft spot for Banner.  You seem pretty invested in him staying," Clint said holding his hands up in an innocent gesture.

"Bruce is one of four people on the planet who can keep up with me, and the only one of them that I can stand.  He's the best lab partner I've ever had, he's saved my life more than once, and he's done more to advance Stark Industries in the last few months than some scientists have done in their entire careers.  Of course I want him to stay!  If you ever pull a stunt like this again, even your perfect aim won't save you!" the billionaire raged as he left the room.

Clint climbed back into the air duct and followed above the engineer as he made his way to the Hulk room.  He watched through the grate as Hulk and Tony smashed things and blew them up until Hulk grew tired and shrunk down into Bruce.

"Did I hurt anyone?" Bruce gasped as soon as he regained consciousness.

"No, everyone's fine.  I suggested that Hulk go to the green room, and he went without a fuss.  Nothing was smashed that wasn't designated for smashing.  Well, maybe the lab floor, but it only has a couple of shallow dents.  I told you the new flooring would hold up well," Tony rambled tenderly.

From where Clint sat, it was so obvious that the billionaire's rambling was an act of love, but those two stupid geniuses were too clueless to get it.  Unless, maybe Tony would be coerced into a confession if Bruce really did feel as guilty as Tony feared.  If Bruce were to threaten to leave . . . Well . . .desperate times call for desperate measures.

"Do we know what caused it this time?" Bruce asked anxiously.  "Because if I'm hulking-out for no reason . . . ."

"Birdbrain shot you in the back," Tony interrupted.

"What?!?  Why would Clint do that?" he asked in disbelief.

"Apparently he thought it was funny.  I swear the guy's probably suffered some sort of brain damage.  But don't worry, he won't try it again.  I made sure of that," Tony commented.

"Thanks, Tony.  Now . . . .could we find me some clothes?" Bruce asked sheepishly.

"Oh, yeah.  I forgot.  Here you go Big Guy," Tony said, handing the physicist a set of clothes.

Clint smacked a hand to his face.  Tony threatened him for Bruce, talked Bruce down after an involuntary hulk-out, and had a conversation with Banner while he was completely naked and neither of them seemed phased by it, but somehow they still didn't know how they felt about each other.  It was maddening!

"You shot Bruce!" Steve cried in disbelief.

"Hey, before you get all judgy on me, I will remind you that just talking to them didn't work when you tried it.  I thought maybe some physical danger would draw a confession out them.  I mean Stark was livid.  It really brought out his protective side," Clint defended. 

"Of course he was livid!  You shot Bruce!" Steve yelled.

"Did it work?" Natasha asked, raising an eyebrow.

Steve looked like he was about to protest, but Natasha silenced him with a flick of her eyes, and turned back to Clint with a knowing glance.

"No.  But in my defense Stark threatening me and talking Banner down were clear acts of love," Clint hastened to justify his actions.

"Aye, but they already engage in many loving actions, but do not recognize them for what they are.  Has this situation changed?" Thor asked seriously.

"No." Clint admitted flatly.

"Perhaps it is time that I use my powers as god of fertility to bring this match together," Thor mused.

"Thor, since they're both men their relationship wouldn't be very fertile.  Are you sure whatever you have planned for them will work?" Natasha questioned.

"I understand your concern, but though they call me the god of fertility, I am better said the god of couples and relationships, whether or not they have the potential of producing offspring," Thor explained.

"Well, whatever it is, it's got to be better than what those two idiots did," she murmured.

"Hey!" Steve and Clint called, but their offended outcry was cut short by a sharp glance from the redhead.

"Good evening, my friends!" Thor boomed as he walked into the dining room.

Bruce and Tony were sitting at the table enjoying a late night meal of Indian takeout.  They had gotten caught up in the lab, and had only just emerged to eat when their stomachs started to protest the long hours without food.

"Good evening,
