"I’ll miss you, Zayn. I’ll miss waking up next to you." Liam said with a very sad and low tone. And Zayn felt sad that Liam was not happy like he used to be in all the times they spent together.

”I’ll call you everyday, Liam. I’ll miss you so much, you know. But i need to see my family, you too. We all need to breathe a little.”Zayn said trying to persuade him.
”But i can’t breathe without you..” Liam whispered slowly.
Zayn couldn’t help his tears falling down. He hugged Liam. He hugged like they were never gonna see each other again. He smelled his beautiful scent. He promised himself to make him happy even if he wasn’t there.

2 days later
Liam was laying on his bed. He was thinking about that two days he didn’t see Zayn. The first day he wasn’t feeling it that much. He really missed his family and his home. He was in a good mood. But on the second day it changed. He felt like a part of him was missing. Of course they talked on the phone but not so long because Zayn’s cousins were there with him and he had to be with them.
He wasn’t angry or pissed at Zayn but he felt like he couldn’t breathe. He was serious when he said he couldn’t breathe without him. Zayn was like air, water, sun… Zayn was anything he needed, he needs and he will ever need.
He was lost in his thoughts as he heard the doorbell ring.
He didn’t go to open it at first but it rang insistently. When he finally reached the door he saw a little boy with a bunch of roses. The little boy smiled ”Liam Payne? This is for you.” He was surprised ”Thanks.” he mumbled before taking the roses. There was a little envelope in it. He opened it immediately
”You look at me as if I’m the only one around,
You make me feel important and never let me down,
You’ve showed me how to live,
How to smile. what to say,
You’ve showed me what its worth,
To love someone each and every day,
I miss you
Zayn…''
Liam couldn’t help smiling. He knew that Zayn loves him so much, he knew that he cared as much as he does, he’s been missing him. He took his phone and dialed his number smiling.

3 days later
Liam was alone at home and he was watching ”Iron Man” maybe for the hundred time again. But he wasn’t actually watching it. He was thinking about Zayn. How lovely was his boyfriend. He imagined him as smiling and that made him smile too.
Liam liked how Zayn smiles. When he smiles, it becomes like a sunshine in a very cloudy day. Whenever he felt alone or sad or nervous, he wanna see or imagine his smile. Zayn was his favorite thing on world and everything about him would make Liam happy.
As he was deep in his thoughts , someone knocked the door. He went to open it and he saw the same boy from yesterday with a difference. He was holding a bunch of daisies instead of roses. He smiled and thanked him. There was an envelope again:
”i ‘ll carry your heart with me
i am never without it
anywhere i go you go,my dear;
no fate, for you are my fate,my sweet
i want no world
you are my world
and it’s you are whatever a moon has always meant
and whatever a sun will always sing is you
I miss you
Zayn”
He felt the butterflies in his stomach again and smiled. Because he felt loved.

The other days went as the same as others. Every day at the same time, the same little boy come to him with a bunch of flower with a note in it. Every day Zayn sent him different kind of flowers. Liam called Zayn everytime after he received his notes and flowers. He wasn’t feeling alone anymore. Every day he was waiting for the boy who would brought flowers to him from his lover.
But on the tenth day the boy didn’t show up. Liam waited for him so long but he didn’t come. He tried to call Zayn but he wasn’t answering it. Liam was telling himself that Zayn must have an important thing. Otherwise he would call him, wouldn’t he?
Liam was trying not to be upset and making excuses for Zayn. But it wasn’t really helping. He felt an ache in his heart. He was missing Zayn so much and couldn’t handle with it. Until a few drops he felt on his cheeks he didn’t know he was crying.

He was in his room when he heard the doorbel was ringing. He thought it would be Andy or Nate, His close friends. He wasn’t waiting to see that when he opened the door.
