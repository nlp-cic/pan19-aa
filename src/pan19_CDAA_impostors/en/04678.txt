bed, but he doesn’t feel fever anymore. He looks at the room while trying to wake up, trying to collect his thoughts, but the only one in his head right now is that he’s thirsty. He turns his head to the bedside table and feels a tingle of warmth when he sees a glass of water there.

He downs it in one go and crawls out of bed.

He finds Jongin and Sehun in the kitchen cooking something that smells like a rice porridge. Junmyeon’s stomach growls.

 - You shouldn’t add salt in it, - Jongin says. – Mom always says it has to be blend when he eats.

 - He doesn’t have a food poisoning, and I’ll only add a little bit of salt, otherwise it’s really not edible, - Sehun says while stirring the pot.

They both turn their heads in unison when he walks out, worry and relief in their eyes.

 - Junnie! – Jongin exclaims, heading to him and sitting him down at the table. Junmyeon still feels like a weak kitten. – You scared the living hell out of us yesterday! Why didn’t you tell us you were feeling sick?

 - You literally fainted at the door, we had to get Jongdae to tell what’s wrong with you, - Sehun turned the gas off and joined them at the kitchen table, taking Junmyeon’s hand in his.  – He said it looked like a flu mixed with fatigue and gave you Ibuprofen. Are you feeling better now? – he asked worriedly, touching his forehead to see if the fever was still there.

 - I think so, - Jumyeon says, voice raspy from his long sleep. – I feel kinda sore. Like, bad sore. And in desperate need of a shower. But the fever passed I think.

 - I’ll get a thermometer, - Jongin gets up and goes to the locker where they keep all their medicines. – Jongdae also said you need to stay in bed, drink a lot of hot fluid and take the pills.

 - I can’t, I have a paper that is due, - Jumnyeon groans, remembering all the stuff he needed to submit and the deadlines that were on him.

Sehun shakes his head.

 - You’re sick, so this is not up for a discussion. You’ll eat now, shower and then will get back to bed and will lie there until you feel better. And it’s Saturday, Junmyeon, whatever it is you have can wait.

Normally, Junmyeon would argue, he really hates it when something fucks up his deadlines, but he feels too weak for that.

 Jongin sits down at the table, giving Junmyeon a thermometer and a pack of pills for him to drink.

 - You’re overworking yourself too much. Your body needs rest, even if you argue that. You can’t run on no sleep no food for a week, Junnie, you know that, - he says and Junmyeon feels even shittier for making both of them worry about him. He’s supposed to be the responsible adult here.  – You really scared us yesterday, we wanted to call the ambulance but figured it’s quicker to get Dae to check up on you since he was home last night and not on his shift in the hospital.

Sehun places a plate of food in front of him and Junmyeon’s stomach growls louder this time, making Jongin and Sehun chuckle.

 - At least your stomach is against this lifestyle as well, - Sehun says, gesturing him to eat, and Junmyeon does. Slowly, but surely, feeling really exhausted.

He takes a cool shower to wash off the stickiness off and changes his clothes before heading back to the bedroom. The boys have changed the sheets and made some hot tea for him. He smiles weakly at the both of them.

 - I feel really tired and shitty, but I can’t sleep anymore – all my body hurts from sleeping too much, - he lies down in bed and lets Sehun put a cover on him. Jongin runs a hand through his hair smiling on him sympathetically.

 - We can catch up on some junk TV to make you feel better, baby, - Jongin suggests and Junmyeon nods at him.

Jongin goes to his room to get his laptop while Sehun dampens the cloth to put on his forehead, the cool fabric feeling amazing against his hot skin.

 - Your temperature dropped, but it’s still high. Dae said to take your meds every 3 hours and if the temperature rises again – we call him, - Sehun is pressing the damp fabric against his face and Junmyeon hopes his tired eyes show how grateful he is for them.

 - Sorry for scaring you both, - he says feeling guilty. He doesn’t like when he needs to be babysitted, especially doesn’t like to make the boys worry. He feels guilty about doing exactly the kind of shit he scolds them for. – I really lost it this week with all the assignments and shit. – He leans into Sehun’s hand and it’s
