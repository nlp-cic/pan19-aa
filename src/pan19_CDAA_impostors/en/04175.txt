every blocked spike. He could see it in the way Hinata's shoulders tensed after every landing, the way his knuckles turned  white from how tightly he  clenched his fists.


 



This isn't like him at all, 

Kageyama thought. 

I need to do something, fast. Meat buns? 

He shook his head and got rid of that thought. 

No, I can't just leave practice, too suspicious. More tosses? Maybe. No, no! The tosses are why he's frustrated. Although, we're a team so he holds some responsibility, too. After all-



 


Kageyama was getting off track. He wracked his brain for anything that could cheer up his partner, hopefully something that was easily attainable.


 


Then, a perfect solution came to mind. An embarrassing one to say the least, but Kageyama knew it would work for sure.


 


So, as soon as he heard the frustrated growl that came from Hinata when 

another

 one of his spikes were blocked, Kageyama did what he and Hinata do best (besides volleyball, obviously). Kageyama grabbed the collar of Hinata's uniform, pulling him up to his height and pressing his lips to the other's.


 


The effect, needless to say, was immediate. Kageyama could feel all of the tension in Hinata's body drain as his short boyfriend closed his eyes and wrapped his arms around his neck, relaxing into the kiss and reciprocating.


 


Kageyama's hands moved from their previous spot on Hinata's collar to his hips as he broke away from the kiss, opening his eyes and resting his forehead on his partner's.


 


"

Sho.

" Kageyama breathed out.

Hinata was stunned. His boyfriend was never one for initiating acts of affection, especially not something as bold as that. Hinata was usually the one to bring about most of the cuddling and kissing (amongst other things) that the couple does.


 


Kageyama was also usually 

extremely

 uncomfortable with public displays of affection, as he is very easily embarrassed.


 


This having been said, what was even more baffling to the ginger was the way he spoke Hinata's name after kissing him.


 


"

Sho.

" Soft, hushed, 

reassuring

. That one word stopped his train of thought, stopped him from blaming himself anymore, made him remember that they’re a team. Kageyama had his back.


 


Even after all the months they've been dating, the way Kageyama can do that is beyond him. He can read Hinata like a book. He wasn’t even sure if anyone else noticed how irked he was, but sure enough, Kageyama did.


 



My boyfriend can't even read a sentence written in English, but he can read my emotions like it's child's play. Un-freaking-believable

, Hinata thought.


 


He looked up at Kageyama, gazing into those midnight blue eyes.“Thank you,” he whispered back. He stood on his tiptoes to leave a kiss on Kageyama’s lips again. Hinata felt fingers carding through his hair, further relaxing him. He sighed into the kiss, parting his lips, allowing Kageyama to--


 


Their impromptu make-out session was (unfortunately, at least in Hinata’s opinion), cut short when the dorky duo heard a series of hoots and a shout of, “GAY SHIT, THAT’S SOME GAY SHIT RIGHT THERE, MMMM GAY SHIT-- sing the chorus with me Bo, GAY SHIT MMMMMM YEAH SHIT GAY SHIT-”


 


At this point, both Kuroo and Bokuto were singing, if you can even call it that. Hinata took one look around the gym and saw Suga and Daichi, who looked a strange combination of horrified and proud (quite fitting for parents).


 


No one on the Karasuno team showed any sign of surprise, however, Tanaka and Noya looked like they were ready to throw Kageyama in a fire for touching their favorite kouhai, and Yamaguchi was hiding his face in Tsukishima’s chest, embarrassed at having just seen such a blatant display of affection.


 


Kenma was the only one (besides the 

still 

meming team captains) out of both teams that didn’t have his jaw on the ground, as Hinata told him about his crush on Kageyama before they became a thing. He heard murmurs of, “Them? But they fight all the time!” and, “Who knew shrimpy got a boyfriend? Maybe there’s hope for you too, Yaku-san! There has to be someone out there willing to lean down so far to kiss you! Y’know, since you’re not that much taller than him anyw-” (Lev ended up limping through the rest of practice).


 



Oh yeah, 

Hinata thought, 

we never formally told them we were dating. Oops.



 


“Maybe we shouldn’t have just assumed everyone knew we were together,” Kageyama said, laughter in his voice. Hinata brought his gaze back to his boyfriend’s face, surprised at the gentle smile that appeared on Kageyama’s lips.


 


The lips that Hinata really, really wanted to kiss again. When the ravenette forced a smile, his face was a thing of nightmares. But when he smiled a lazy
