so-big field nearby,

 

The two laid down on the grassy field, golden and brown eyes looking up to the night sky, the bright, pastel moon shone brightly tonight as it seems there are no clouds in the sky tonight, along with bright stars decorating all around it, completing the night sky, the calm breeze ran through the grass, gently caressing their hairs, giving them a calm feeling,

 

"Tsukki, are you nervous for tomorrow?" Yamaguchi asked,

Tsukishima thought for a while before answering, then spoke, "not really, i suppose,"

 

"I wonder what our opponents be like tomorrow, i bet all of them would be so talented! of course they would since they actually managed to be in the nationals, i wonder if one of the players will be like Ushijima-" Tsukishima stared at Yamaguchi fondly, a soft, small, smile crept up his face as he listened to his childhood friend talks, his brown eyes looking up to the sky as he imagined what tomorrow will be like,

 

"And then- Tsukki, you're staring," Yamaguchi said, his freckled cheeks turning slightly red,

"So what if i am?" Tsukishima asks,

Yamaguchi sat up, and rambled, "i-it's kind off embarrassing i guess? i don't know i'm just not used to it, it's not like i don't mind you staring, it's just-"

"Tadashi, shut up," Tsukishima cutted off,

"Sorry, Kei," Yamaguchi said, scratching his cheek with his finger,

 

 

They've been using first name basis when they're all alone, if they use it carelessly in public, the freak duo might freak out or something, and Yamaguchi is not sure that Tsukishima  will be fine with him calling his first name in public,


"So, you were unusually talking about the match, that doesn't happen often, what's wrong?" Tsukishima asked,

 

Yamaguchi froze, of course he'd realize, Tsukishima isn't in the college preparation class for nothing is he? So Yamaguchi just let it out, Yamaguchi trusts him,

 

"Well, it's just, i started to think like, i'm not needed,"

"But-"



"I know, i know that i'm a pinch server, of course they'd need me, but i feel like im not needed outside the match, it's like, i'm just a no one ,who's right there, with no one paying attention to me, not a single bit, until i'm needed, as a pinch server, that is my job, you see? this probably makes no sense," Yamaguchi spoke, Tsukishima listened to him carefully, sitting up as he spoke, sure he may not look like it but Tsukishima deeply cares for his childhood friend, and he is going to help him,

There was silent afterwards, neither of them spoke a single word, Yamaguchi's brown eyes starts to tear up as he finished talking about his actual feelings, about what has been going on in his head,

 

"Tsukki-"

"I am the moon, you are the stars, the night sky is my life," Tsukishima spoke, staring into Yamaguchi's teary eyes,

"Without the stars, the night sky is all bland and incomplete, and the moon will be all alone in the night sky," Tsukishima said, 

 

Yamaguchi thought for a while about what it means, until everything clicked together,

 

"Without you, my life will be bland and incomplete, and i will be all alone, Tadashi, you are needed, i need you, Tadashi," Tsukishima said, smiling fondly to Yamaguchi, taking Yamaguchi's hands in his own, and gently placed a soft kiss in his hands,

"So don't you ever forget that, because if you're gone, i will be all alone, and i will have no one to be there for me like you've always been, and i promise from now on, i will be there for you like you've always been to me, no matter what, Tadashi," Tsukishima said,

A few tears escaped Yamaguchi's eyes, rolling down his cute freckled cheeks, "thank you, Kei," he cried out, Tsukishima gently took Yamaguchi in his arms, holding his crying childhood friend,

Tsukishima caressed Yamaguchi's cheeks, took both of his hands in his cheeks, and lifted Yamaguchi's face, and wiped away the running tears with his thumbs, and kissed the last drop of tear, their faces now inches apart,

 

"I love you, Tadashi, i really do," Tsukishima said,

"I-i love you too, Kei," Yamaguchi said,

"You're cute you know that?" Tsukishima said as he leaned in, and gently pressed his lips to Yamaguchi's who gently returned the favour, 

The two players kissed there, in the grassy field, under the night sky filled with stars, and the bright moon, their lips moved in sync, it's like their lips are made for each other
