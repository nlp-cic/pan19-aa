sucking in his breath.

Inhaling the smoke.


Zayn, stop. 


Sucking in his cheeks, exhaling.

Blurring smoke.


No. 


He couldn’t stop.

He had to touch him.


Zayn. 


Shaking his head, Liam pulled away.

Zayn shut his eyes.

Pain.


Don't go.


Silence, thick silence.

Mixing with the smoke.

Blurring Zayn's thoughts.


You can't do that, Zayn. 


He knew.


I know. 


Silence again.

It hurt.

His steps.

Fading away.

Out of his sight.

Gone.

He was gone.

Inhaling.

Exhaling.

Higher, higher, higher.

His eyes rolled back.

His lips parted.

Thick smoke in his head.

He smiled, softly.


Goodbye, Liam.


——


"The road is now calling, and I must go away"


 


 Happy birthday. 


Zayn smiled, grinning widely.

Stretching his arms out.

They hugged.

Their breaths entangled.

United.

Chests pressed together.

But he had to forget.

About his twirling skin, the racing heart and his addiction to be close to him.

Always close.

He pulled away.


I got you a present, Zayn. 


Grinning.

Rustling of paper.

Scratchy paper.

Like his chin.

His beautiful face.


You didn't have to. 


Shrugging, winking.

Zayn gulped.


I did anyways.



I know. You always do. 


Zayn looked away.


I know.


Soft, tender voice.

It hurt, but he had to forget.

His fingers ripping open the paper.

A cut.

He ignored it.

He was supposed to be happy.


I love it, Liam. 


He loved him.

So much.


Thought so. 


But he didn't love him back.

And he never would.


Thanks, mate. 


He wanted to hug him.

Until his need disappeared.

But he held his distance.

Silence between them.


Look, I have to go. 


Zayns eyes started burning.


Why? 


He always had to leave.


I'm sorry, Zayn. 


He nodded.

He always was.


Can you hug me? 


Guilt in Liam's eyes.


Zayn- 


Zayn squeezed his eyes shut.


Not today, Liam. I - I need you to hug me. Please. 


He didn't want to cry. Again.

He was supposed to be happy.

But he wasn't.

Even though Liam wrapped his arms around him, pulled him towards him.

Because he knew it wouldn't last. It would never last.

But he pressed his face into Liam's shoulder.

His fingers pulled on Liam's shirt, as he tried pulling him closer, because it was never enough.

Never enough.

Soft lips pressed against his forehead.


I have to go. 



I know. 



You know, I don't want to. 


Pleading, brown eyes.

Zayn tried to smile.


Yeah. 


Pulling each other close again.

Eyes closing.

Knowing.

Knowing it couldn't be.

It couldn't last.


Goodbye. 


——  


"But I don't regret, nor will I forget, all who took the road with me"


 

 


 I did it, Zayn, I did it! 


Liam, pressing his sweaty hands against Zayn's face.

Wide grins.

Happiness swirling through his body.


I know, I knew you would, Liam. 


Liams arms wrapped around Zayn's small body.

Tiny, next to him.

So tiny.

Thin.


I - I can't believe it!


Zayn smiled.

He was happy.

For him.

He loved his smile.

His beautiful smile.

Liams heart next to his.


Thank you, Zayn. 


A soft smile.


For what? 


Surprise, in Zayn's eyes.


Everything. 


He pressed his head against Zayn's, so painfully close.

Liam had to stop.

Zayn wanted to kiss him.

So bad.

His soft lips.

Those beautiful lips.


You're always there for me. 


He was.

And would always be.

He loved him.

So much, it hurt.

Zayn pulled away, touching his cheek.


I'm happy for you. 


Grins.

Smiles.

Laughter.

Champagne.


I'll make a toast. 


Lazy, drunken words.


To what? 


Sweet liquid savouring his tongue.


To old Liam. 



Old Liam?



Old Liam. 


Zayn raised his glass.

Mirroring Liams motions.


To my old self, my lack of ambition and surprising luck. 


Zayn grinned, lips on his glass.

Touching the cool material.

Even though they should be touching Liams lips.


To old Liam - may he never come back. 


Zayn nodded to his words.

Glasses clinking.


Good bye old Liam. 


——


"We came all this way, but now comes the day, to bid you farewell" 


 


Stop it! 


Zayn stopped Liam from tugging at his shirt.

Pouting.


But it's hot in here. 


Zayn rolled his eyes at him.

Trying to smile.


Open the window then. 


Liam grinned.

Coming closer.

Too close.

He would enjoy it any other day.

But not that day.


What if I don't want to do that? 


Zayn didn'
