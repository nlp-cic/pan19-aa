couldn’t find him. He looked around but, there was only him, and the villain he defeated. He looked everywhere but, the only escape he could find was the broken windows but, he wouldn’t go there, it didn’t make any sense, but still he looked outside, to check at the same time, if the police had arrived. However the first thing is noticed was the puddle of blood surrounding his partner who had fell from the several floor of the building.

Bakugo ran in the stairs, to get on the first floor, where he rushed outside, beside his partner. He fell on his knees when he saw him, breathing heavily, his eyes closed, and his foots probably broken from the fall, he was bleeding a lot, and the blond wondered if he could survive to this.

- Hey bastard, wake up.

It took time but, he finally opened his grey eye, to weak to open the other, and he stared at his partner, with an empty look. The blond felt like he couldn’t breathe, he was suffocating, hyper-ventilating, he was attacked by guilt, because he knew that he was the responsible for his state, because he didn’t listened to him, and had made a too powerful explosion in a closed room. He had been so caught in the fight, too determined to win, that he had forgotten about his partner’s security.

- Damn it ! Help will come, ok ? Just don’t die already.

He gripped his top, trying to get rid of the terrible emotions he felt but, he couldn’t, he was so mad at himself. He wanted to do something but, in the situation, he was powerless, he couldn’t move his partner, because if he had hurt his head, it would have been worse, and if his foots were broken, he couldn’t make him stand. He waited for the professionals, and seconds felt like hours.

- Baku...

- Don’t speak.

Bakugo waited in silence again, then he saw his partner close his eye, and he panicked.

- Hey, HEY, don’t die !

The other didn’t answer, he just had this peaceful look on his face, as if he was dying, and the blond noticed that his breathes were getting weaker, his force was slowly leaving him. The blond put his hands on his chest to feel his heartbeat, and his breath, he was still alive, his condition only went worse, as time passed, Bakugo wondered if he would stay alive, and this thought alone terrified him. Then it all stopped, he didn’t feel anything under his fingers, it wasn’t rising anymore.

- Todoroki, you bastard, don’t fucking die !

He rolled up his sleeves, and tried to make his heart beat again, he organized first aid, that he learnt at U.A, when they were classmates. They hadn’t got along but, soon they had learnt how to trust each other, became close enough to be considered as friends, even so they had never made it official. Sometimes, their tempters were so different that they easily argued but, some other times, they completed each other, and those moments were the best they ever had with someone. There were times when Todoroki’s cold personality would calm Bakugo, and others, when Bakugo’s explosive personality would motivate Todoroki.

The blond felt like if he lost the other now, he would lose more than he thought, and loss wasn’t a word that he could accept. He had always thought that loosing fights were the worst, until his classmate was laying on the ground, surrounded by his own blood, lifeless ; he understood that death was the worst loss. It made his eyes teary, and he felt like he was the one dying. Was Todoroki this important ?

- Wait until we're older to die, bastard !

Having no reaction, after several attempts, he decided to share his air with him, by giving him a mouth-to-mouth ; he hated the idea, more than anything but, he didn’t have time to be difficult, he had to act quickly. So he did, what needed to be done, his hand on his chest to control any reaction but, he stayed dead. However he didn’t loose hope, because he always won, that’s what he believed ; but, he was crying, and he couldn’t stop it, the other was already dead, and he knew it.

- I’m…

He didn't felt anything anymore, under his hands. He tried again, and again, as he was yelling at the dead boy, begging him to stay alive. He wasn't really religious but, if there was a god somewhere, he wished he heard him. 

- … Sorry.

Then, the police arrived with an ambulance, the doctors checked Todoroki's state, and then shook their head, as a negative sign. They covered his
