wanted a friend?"

"I do want to be friends! It's just that.." Ruffling his hair, he groaned frustratedly, "I have actual feelings for him."

When nobody spoke up, Phichit deflated and sighed, "Thanks for the support, guys."

Guang Hong and Yuuri gave Leo pointed looks and Leo raised his arms defensively, silently mouthing at them 'what?'

"Look, P," Yuuri started, hand on Phichit's shoulder, "We just don't want you to hope and get hurt, okay?"

"Yeah," came Phichit's defeated tone of reply.

The three looked at each other, then Guang Hong cleared his throat, "So, what about your vlog idea? You going with it?"

Phichit visibly perked up and nodded enthusiastically, "Yeah, definitely! We're going to meet up tomorrow afternoon for it!"

Yuuri and Leo sighed in relief as Phichit rambled on and on to a sincerely curious Guang Hong. "Guang Hong is a genius. A genius, I tell you," Yuuri muttered to Leo.

Safe, for now. Yuuri pumped a fist to himself.

To: Lee Seung Gil

Hi! How are you?

Phichit giggled to himself and threw his phone somewhere on the bed, reaching for his hamsters in the cage.

As soon as they were let out, Fluffy Kim took it upon herself to climb up his body and perched herself up on his head, curled up into a fluffy ball of hamster. Peachy Quinn, on the other hand, squeaked and climbed up to his shoulder, rubbing herself over his cheek.

Phichit laughed and lovingly rubbed her head, "Aw, hi there, Peach!"

A ping ran through the room and Phichit hastily shot forward for his phone, making Fluffy Kim almost fall off his head. She squeaked in surprise and Phichit immediately held her in place, regretting his actions, "Oh my god, Kim, I'm sorry!"

He unlocked his phone and eagerly read Seung Gil's reply.

From: Lee Seung Gil

Hey. I'm fine.

Phichit furrowed his eyebrows and thought of what to reply.

To: Lee Seung Gil

You reaaaally don't say much, huh?

From: Lee Seung Gil

It is too much work.

Phichit had let out giggles at that and grinning, he typed out a reply.

To: Lee Seung Gil

For some reason, you do seem to be the type to not reply at all.

From: Lee Seung Gil

Should I be happy with that?

Blinking, Phichit hummed to himself. Fluffy Kim scurried off his head and fell to his lap. Phichit absentmindedly rubbed the hamster's head.

To: Lee Seung Gil

I didn't mean that in a bad way! I swear! It's just that, uh, from your vlogs, I gathered that you hate doing unnecessary things!

From: Lee Seung Gil

I do hate doing unnecessary things.

Phichit fought off the urge to laugh. He literally could hear that coming from Seung Gil's own mouth.

To: Lee Seung Gil

Then, aren't I an excellent judge of character?

A few minutes passed and Seung Gil still hasn't replied. Phichit frowned and took Fluffy Kim in his hands and whined, "Why do you think he hasn't replied, Fluffy Kim? Does he think I'm weird after all?"

Just when he could start bawling his eyes out to his confused hamster, his phone let out a ping. A message notification.

Most likely from Seung Gil.

From: Lee Seung Gil

Why did you message me?

Phichit frowned. He didn't like the sound of that. Biting his lip, he typed up a reply

To: Lee Seung Gil

I just wanted to.

From: Lee Seung Gil

They say I'm too stoic and that I have a rude mouth. Why would you want to talk to a person like that?

Phichit stared at his reply incredulously. Who the fuck dared to say something like that to Seung Gil? Fucking hell, Phichit swore he would cut a bitch.

To: Lee Seung Gil

No, you're not! You're just being you, and if they don't like that, then it's their loss! And you don't have a rude mouth, you're just really blunt and straightforward that people end up misunderstanding you!

Phichit cooled himself off and muttered to himself, "Seriously. Who the fuck is the bitch?"

His phone pinged.

From: Lee Seung Gil

I guess you're not half-bad.

Phichit's heart sang at his words and he hummed happily, typing out a reply.

To: Lee Seung Gil

Thank you. You're not half-bad yourself. :)

hi i am back from the abyss

"So? How was your vlog?"

On the other line, Seung Gil sighed deeply, "Usual." Phichit blinked to himself, "Usual?"

"Yes."

Phichit stared blankly at the wall in front of him and said in an equally blank tone, "Seung Gil, when I said it, I meant I didn't
