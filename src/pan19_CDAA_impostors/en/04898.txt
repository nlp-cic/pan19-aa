stepping between the piles of clothes lying on the floor and envelopes and pulled the drawers of the desk, also littered with all sorts of rubbish. He himself did not know for sure what he was looking for, perhaps a diary or photographs, something that could give him some information. Under the pile of bills on the table, only some detective stories were found.
.
From the corner of his eye, he caught some movement  - but it was just his reflection in the mirror. It reminded him of yesterday's improvised concert and made him smirk.
.
He found the diary in the back of one of the drawers of the desk. It was a thick leather bound book, obviously handed to SKull by someone who did not want to puzzle over a gift that he really would like. Several sheets were torn from it, but Reborn was almost sure that there was no important information on them, and that they were torn out, only to quickly record something like a telephone number for a repair shop for motorcycles or something. Because almost all the remaining sheets were clean, only on the title page there was an inscription "diary" and a pair of hastily puffed-up faces, and the next one under the date was the first and only record: "From childhood, I knew that I was fucking up."
.
.
There were several letters under the diary in printed envelopes, but Reborn did not have time to study them because at that moment the approaching bellow of a motorcycle was heard and he had to leave through the window so that he was not found.
.
It's strange, it seems that SKull left recently. Did the entertainment not work out?

It wasn't long before someone was knocking at his door.

"Hey, are you at home?"

Reborn threw open the door, and Skull jumped back. He looked unhappy and disheveled, a trace on his cheek, which looked to be from a slap to the face.

"The girls refuse to ride a motorcycle?" Reborn asked with a grin. 

Skull silently pushed him away and walked into the apartment, unzipping his jacket on the way. 

"It is much more serious than that. You have to help me."

Reborn cocked an eyebrow. 

"They want to kill me!" 

"Her husband was a master of sports in martial arts?"

"It's not funny! "

SKull threw off his jacket and sat down on the bed. He looked pale and frightened. 

"Are you sure?" Reborn asked cautiously, sitting next to him. "If you quarreled, your girlfriend could talk to her husband in a temper."

"She's not my girlfriend anymore," Skull waved. "And that's not the point. They are hunting me. Seriously. "

"Did you do something?" 

"Nothing. That is, depending on what counts as 'done'..." he hesitated. "But it's different. It's a real maniac."

"Yah..."

"Right! I just discovered that someone was rummaging through my things while I was gone." 

Oops. 

"Are you sure? Your things are scattered all over the room, so ..." 

"Exactly, I tell you. My lipstick is gone!" 

Reborn mechanically checked his pockets, although he remembered well that he did not touch the lipstick. 

"Maybe under the bed?"

"Come on, it's just that. Recently, I constantly feel someone's eyes on me. As if someone was tracking me down." He shivered. "And then they told me that someone was asking about me at the studio. And this letter ..."

"What letter?" 

"Usual. Well, you know, which all the maniacs write to popular movie stars."

Reborn was silent for a moment. 

"And you did not try to address to the psychotherapist? As it is customary for you, for movie stars." 

"I've come up with a better way. It's necessary to make this maniac lose my track. I will recolor myself as an ashy blond and temporarily move in with you." 

Reborn whistled. 

"Really, great idea. What happens if I refuse?"

"Yes, it's a great idea.  Why would you refuse?" Skull nudged him in the side. "Do not be afraid, dyeing your hair is not difficult."

Th ebathroom was barely big enough for two people. SKull sat on a chair with a broken back, throwing an old shirt on his bare shoulders. Reborn rolled up his shirt sleeves and picked up a tube of paint and a bottle of developer. 

"Mix it, but do not shake it," he repeated to himself. 

"The main thing is that the color turns out to be uniform."

As soon as he touched Skall's hair, he trustingly leaned back, slightly throwing back his head. His eyes were closed. Reborn ran his fingers through the chestnut strands, removing them from his forehead, and thought, looking in the mirror at the defenselessly exposed neck, that a sharp knife or a blade of a razor could now solve the
