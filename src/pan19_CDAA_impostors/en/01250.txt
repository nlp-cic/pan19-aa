.  As the blows, the slashes and kicks landed on him he gave into the pain and accepted it.  There was nothing left to give or to hope for.  He had failed before he had begun.xxx

When they had finally finished playing with their toy (who was no longer as much fun since he’d eventually stopped screaming and writhing in agony) two of the Willing Ones picked up the bundle of blood and rags and threw him into the hut with the other one.  

Let them spend what little time was left together.  Afterall, thought Mawr, the rift between them was so great that leaving them together would only heighten Emrys’ sense of betrayal.  All to the good, the more damaged he was the easier the ceremony would be.

“Soon, my Master, soon” he prayed.

Chapter 10Arthur half ran, half stumbled to where Merlin had been thrown.  But as he reached out to him he paused.  He could not tell if Merlin was breathing.  What if he was already gone, if he had been hurt so much that his slight frame had been unable to take it?  Only touching him would tell Arthur if what he dreaded was true or not.  But still he hesitated, his unbroken arm stretched out in front of him.  Arthur could not bear the thought that Merlin might be gone and that he had died hating and despising him.  

“What are you thinking Pendragon” Arthur admonished himself “If he is gone you will have to bear what you did but if he is still alive then he needs your help.” And, with the imagined voice of his own inner Sergeant-At-Arms yelling in his head, Arthur reached out a still reluctant hand and touched Merlin’s arm.  Reaching down the sleeve of the ruined, bloody jacket for the skinny wrist he felt for a pulse.  Oh, God, nothing.  Wait, it was there, small, uneven but there.  Merlin was alive.  

But staring in horror Arthur was able to finally take in the full extent of the young man’s injuries.  By the light of the small lamp Arthur could see that his face was swollen and so covered in bruises it was hard to recognise the normally aquiline features.  One cheekbone was badly cut and his lips were ripped and bleeding.  There were numerous small cuts and shallow knife wounds all over him and one deep gash in his side that was still bleeding badly.  Merlin’s chest and stomach were a mass of blue, purple and red contusions and it would have been a miracle if he had not broken at least 1 or 2 ribs.  Putting his ear close to Merlin’s chest Arthur could hear shallow hesitant breathing – at least it did not sound as though any ribs had punctured the lungs.  There did not seem to be a square inch on him that had not been battered or kicked.  Then Arthur remembered the magical pain inflicted on Merlin.  Lord alone knew what damage that had done.

For a moment Arthur was at a total loss, forgetting his years of tending to comrades battlefield wounds.  All he could think was that he had little with him to help Merlin.  But again, pushing aside his feelings of panic Arthur pulled himself together – being too emotional now could mean Merlin’s death.  He had to think.  Cursing his slowness in thinking of it Arthur took off Merlin’s scarf and pressed it down onto the largest wound to try and staunch the flow of blood.  He ripped his own jacket into strips and tied the scarf in place with the material, then gently lifted Merlin’s head into his lap and supported his injured friend.  Merlin gave a small moan at the movement and his face tightened up with the pain.  Even as deeply unconscious as he was the agony reached down and grabbed him. Arthur tried to wipe his face clean of the dried blood but it was no use and just seemed to be causing more anguish.

For an hour Arthur sat still with Merlin lying there, motionless and failing.  Arthur was a soldier and he had seen enough men die to know that Merlin was losing the battle to stay alive.  He had to do something.  Laying Merlin down as gently as he could, Arthur got to his feet unsteadily, pain from his own arm returning for the first time since Merlin’s arrival had banished it from his mind.  Ignoring it, Arthur walked wearily to the door of the hut and yelled in his best Princely fashion:

“I demand to speak to whoever is in charge.  Now.” 

He didn’t think pleading would help, these soulless husks of men would not respond to that.  So he took a chance that whoever had done this to them would have left them with the instinct to respond to authority (in order to be able to control them).  Demands, he felt were the only
