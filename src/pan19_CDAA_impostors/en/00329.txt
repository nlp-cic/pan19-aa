sore body and cooed over him as they drove over to Dean’s apartment where they had shared a sensual, slow shower and a great meal.

And all the while Castiel had been feeling off.

Getting a bite from Dean would mean that they were mated and that he was definitely Dean’s and he wanted that, so much. And the probability that Dean maybe just used talks of biting as dirty talk was putting a damper on Castiel’s mood. God, he had known for a long time that he wanted Dean but what if the Alpha was simply playing with Castiel?

Dean was always going on about how he had never felt like this before and how their scents mixed so well. That sounded like mating talk to Castiel. He supposed it could be because he was too young and Dean might not want a snot-nosed high schooler for a mate. But still, Castiel would be graduating soon and Dean was not that much older than him.

He wished he could talk to someone about it but didn’t know where to begin or whom to entrust with these emotions. He should talk to Dean but he didn’t dare. Because what if Dean really didn’t want to mate? What if a serious conversation about it would convince Dean that Castiel was more work than it was worth?

Fuck, Castiel was in such a funk and this was not the time to be at a party with drunk, horny teenagers. He should leave but he had only been there for an hour. Even if he was being a downer Balthazar would never let him live if he left already.

Didn’t stop him from going upstairs though. The party was mostly kept downstairs but if Castiel was caught up in his friend’s room he could just say he had drunk a little too much. Being best friends with the host had to have some perks, right?

He was fiddling with his phone before he even knew what he was doing. So he hadn’t seen Dean for two days but they had talked plenty over the phone. The Alpha was starting to catch on that something wasn’t right, too. He had sounded worried last time they talked and Castiel’s whole being longed to right the wrong because it wasn’t Dean’s fault that Castiel couldn’t express how he was feeling.

Loud bass was pumping from downstairs and Castiel could hear the sound of his friends having fun. It felt like half the high school had been invited and the house practically reeked of their combined scents. Balthazar’s parents would be so mad when they got back from Maui.

He bit his lower lip while he waited, unsure what he was even doing and why he was so nervous.

Awful. Castiel wished Dean was there. Or, rather, he wished he was at Dean’s apartment, waiting for the Alpha to get home.

Castiel’s heart fluttered at the prospect. They had discussed it yesterday and yes, he would very much like to come see Dean, of course he would.

I will. When do you get off work?

God he wished he was better at expressing himself. Kind of in general but especially in text messages. He always sounded so stilted. Well, no time like the present, he supposed. He had been drinking a little and was longing for his Alpha.

should be done b4 2, u could come at 3 :)

Perfect setup, really. Now or never, he supposed and was incredibly glad for what little liquid courage he had been able to imbibe. In reality he wasn’t even drunk because one and a half beers weren’t enough to get him really going but it would have to be enough for this.

Oh I could come, could I?

He bit his lip again when he read what he had written. It sounded stupid. Either it was too little for Dean to understand the sexual innuendo or it was just enough but still sounded juvenile. He wished there was a way for him to take back texts but his phone dinged with Dean’s answer before he could do much of anything.
