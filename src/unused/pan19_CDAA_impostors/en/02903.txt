the two figures with white hair like his own, watching him.

Akefia looked at Marik, “Just a song I heard,” he simply replied.

“Where, exactly?” Marik asked, “I haven’t heard anything new lately…”

Akefia smiled impishly at his friend, replying, “I heard it in the graveyard last night.”

“What!? And your singing it!?” Marik exclaimed, “What’s wrong with you!?”

“It’s a good song,” Akefia defended, “And besides, I don’t have any problems with graveyards.”

“Whatever, man” Marik replied, turning towards the front, since the teacher walked in.

‘They’re just gonna try and make me try and do something I don’t care about,’ he thought while sighing, ‘It’s my future, so I should worry about it.’

Looking forward, Akefia gasped, seeing the strange lights again. They danced around more wildly, and Akefia heard more of the song he heard last night:



“The night we’ve been waiting is drawing near,”“The deep night of Halloween,”“From now on it’s our time, Let’s play;”





“I want pumpkin pie, candies,”“And a whole cake,”“If you don’t have treats,”“We might trick you badly.”



“Please don’t run away, again,” Akefia said, stopping in his tracks, “I just want to hear you sing…and to meet you.”

The lights flickered towards Akefia, before disappearing. Akefia sighed in sadness, sitting on the graveyard ground. He looked up in shock, hearing two “Meows” in front of him. The two black cats from last night were sitting in front of him. And they had a piece of candy with them.

“Hey, you two” Akefia said to the black cats, stroking them both, “Is that for me?”

One of the cats nudged the candy towards Akefia.

Akefia smiled to the cats, “Thanks. I wish I could of brought something for you guys.”

The cats “Meow”ed, and simply trotted away, leaving Akefia to eat his candy.

Akefia slipped the candy into his coat pocket, and left the graveyard again. If he had turned around, he would have seen the two white-haired figures again.

“Though, I would really like it if you didn’t go back to the graveyard tonight” Marik said, “I’m worried about you getting into trouble.”

“Your worrying over nothing, Marik” Akefia told his friend, “It’s not like the cats are gonna kill me.”

“Not the cats” Marik started, “the lights.”

Before he could question his friend further, the teacher came in, and told them all to take their seats.

“The door of night is right there,”“If we open the window, we might jump off it!”“Bring only one match,”“And then you can join us,”





“On Halloween night;”



Akefia reached the Mausoleum again, and was shocked to see two figures dancing around. One had on an oversized cat-hoodie shirt, (black), with orange shorts and a orange collar with a bell. He wore short black stripped socks, with black male slip-on shoes.

The other looked feminine, but was clearly a boy.

He wore an oversized black shirt, with a collar. His shorts were frilled at the bottom, and were also orange. He wore an orange bow collar with a bell, and a black bow tied into his hair, with hair clips, (with one with a star), all black. He wore long black stripped socks, with black slip-on shoes.

They both had white hair, and blue eyes, and holding black lanterns.

“Whoa…” Akefia breathed in awe. The two we’re pretty good.



“Meow~“C’mon, let’s get it fired up,”“Demon is always on our side,”





“Meow~”“That’s right,”“We can become even Will o’ the wisp,”





“At the dark night,”“Let’s set fire to guide you.”



“Our audience seems to have arrived” the one in the cat-hoodie said, “Didn’t he say before that he was jealous of us, Ryou?”

The other one, named Ryou, giggled happily, before replying, “Yes he did, Bakura!”

“What…are you two those black cats?” Akefia asked in shock. Bakura and Ryou nodded, “Did you want to join us, Akefia? You won’t have to worry about your future, like your always thinking, “Ryou said.

“…I…I don’t know…” Akefia said nervously, “My friend, Marik…” Akefia was saying, but was cut off by Bakura, “If this Marik person is so worried about you, how come he’s not here?”

“Huh?” Akefia responded in shock.

Bakura replied, “He’s so worried about us hurting you, and yet he’s not even here to help you.”

“
