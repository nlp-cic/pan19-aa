Sirius."

"Blow it            out your arse." Remus muttered as he scrapped at the eggs with a spatula.

"He's so            pleasant first thing in the morning," Tonks said to Severus. She stood            up and cracked her back. "As much as I would love to stay for breakfast,            I've got to go. Busy, busy, you know. Enjoy the Wolfsbane, Remy."

"I will            as much as I always do," Remus said, his voice full of false cheer.            "Try not to splinch yourself on the way home."

Tonks swatted            his arse and blew a kiss to Severus before heading back into the bedroom            to get dressed.

Remus turned            to look at Severus, a contrite expression on his face. "She usually            leaves right afterwards. The woman is a menace."

"One of            the many reasons to stick to men." Severus held out his coffee mug.            "She drank my coffee."

Remus looked            at him oddly. "You let her."

"I was            being friendly. Kindly repay me by getting me a fresh cup."

"Are you            afraid of Tonks germs?" asked Remus as he took the mug from Severus.            He dumped it in the sink, pouring him a fresh mug.

"I'll leave            the Tonks germs to you." Severus took a sip. "I have no desire to incorporate            them in my body at this time. Or ever."

Remus snorted            and sat down next to him. "She's not that bad when she's naked."

"Neither            was Lord Voldemort."

Remus winced            and shook his head, pushing a plate of eggs at Severus. "I really didn't            need to know that you saw him naked."

"Saw who            naked?" Tonks walked out of the bedroom, fixing her robes as she headed            towards them again. "Dish, boys."

"Leave,            Tonks," Remus said as he handed her a wrapped egg sandwich. "Thank you            for the Wolfsbane."

"I never            get to hear the fun stuff." Tonks stuffed the sandwich in a pocket and            kissed Remus's cheek. "I'll drop in when I get a chance."

"Never            would be too soon," Remus said, but he kissed her cheek in return. "Get            out of here."

Tonks snubbed            her nose at him and waved at Severus. "I'll see if I can scrounge up            some more Dreamless Sleep."

"I sleep            just fine in my bed," Severus said to her. "I much prefer it to the            couch."

"I'll remember            that the next time I'm over," said Tonks with a grin. "Perhaps we'll            just use the kitchen table."

"Hardly."            Remus pushed her towards the door. "Don't you have someplace to be?"

"Bugger.            I'm late for my hair appointment."

"You're            a metamorph."

"It was            a euphemism for an appointment with an old friend." Tonks grimaced and            shook her head. "I'm off."

And with            that, she finally Disapparated, leaving Severus and Remus alone again.            Remus turned to see Severus looking at him with an inscrutable look.            Remus flushed slightly and turned away again.

"I think            I'll shower," Remus said softly. "Enjoy the eggs."

"Do you            not want any?"

"I'm not            hungry anymore."

"What do            you call this thing?" asked Remus, peering at the over-sized coffee            mug in front of him. Severus sipped from his own over-sized mug, his            black hair tied back with a leather strap.

"A hazelnut            cappuccino."

"And what            exactly are you drinking?"

"Vanilla            and almond latte." Remus sniffed his mug. "It smells a little strange."

"Pretend            that you do not have werewolf senses for a moment and just drink the            blasted thing."

"How much            time do you spend in this place?" Remus looked around at the small coffee            shop that was surprisingly empty for the time of day. The girl that            was working had abandoned her spot behind the counter in favour of a            computer against the back wall.

"A few            hours a day, I suppose." Severus set his mug on the table. "Are you            not going to try it?"

"I really            just prefer tea." Remus said but gamely took a sip of the coffee â€¦ thing.            "It's not bad."

Severus            sniffed slightly and shook his head. "You have no sense of adventure."

"I tasted            it!"

"And dismissed            it as 'not bad.'"

Remus took            a large gulp and glared at Severus defiantly. Severus just raised an            eyebrow and pushed the newspaper towards Remus.

"I have            circled a few possibilities that seem to be in a decent neighborhood            and within our budget."

"Severus,            we have no budget." Remus looked over at him. "You know that."

"I have            no real desire to use more of Harry's money than necessary," Severus            said quietly, his gaze focused on his hands. "Or Black's."

"His name            was Sirius."

"I have            spent many years attempting to not utter his given name unless needed."            Severus
