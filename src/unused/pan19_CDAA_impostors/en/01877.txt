What is next Merlin? Kill me? Or more than that? What did I do wrong to you Merlin? You actually want to do is what?…"

"No Arthur. Stop it. Don't insult me this way. You're wrong. Yes I've magic but I used it only for you Arthur. I didn't ever do any harms to you. I saved your life with that magic. You had no idea.…"

"Of course I'd no idea. I have still no idea. You know Camelot has no place for magic. You. I thought the closest person for me has magic and you's lied. I can't believe Merlin. I don't believe in you anymore. Go. Go away. I don't want to see your face anymore. Get lost from my sight. Or I don't know what I'd do to you."

"No Arthur. I can't. I can't leave you alone. I've to protect you. I… I"

"I said GO AWAY Merlin."

Arthur yells at Merlin. Massive tears are falling down from Merlin's eyes. Merlin can't believe everything are happening that fast. He looks at Arthur with teary eyes for the last time and flees away to nowhere his legs carry him. Gaius is amazed and Arthur is closing his eyes and they are left behind. 

(I'm sorry I didn't know there was some paragraph left. I've added them now. How can I fill the inconvinence of some readers who have read before???) 






 

After some time like ages Arthur exhales heavily and slowly opens his eyes. Gaius is still in front of him.

"You've already known Gaius? Why?"

Gaius sighs and one of his eyebows is lifted.

"Why what?"

"Why didn't you tell me about that. About him. I believed in you. And him. Why could you do that to me?"

"What My Lord? You also want me to get lost? or punish me? It's okay My Lord. You can"

"No Gaius. I won't do. You know what I feels. betrayed. cheated. I'm sad. I hurt Gaius. Betraying on trust is so bad. Betraying on trust by the person I believe in most is the worst."

"I've no word Sire. All I can say is that Merlin didn't do any evil things on you. He never lied to you apart from his magic. He always protect you with his magic and his life. You'll understand one day."

Arthur doesn't reply any back. He's got too much emotions in such a short time. Everything was happening so fast. The one he trust went away. The feeling he treasured was destroyed. Arthur walks away from the physician quarter unconsciously. Everything is like a dream. He wishes he wake up very soon.

 

Arthur gazes into nowhere in the air and all the thoughts in his mind is going to the certain one. The trace of sweetness and wetness are still tingling on his lips. Arthur is tracing his lips with fingers absent mindedly.

"Arthur"

"Merlin?"

As soon as he hears a girly voice Arthur's instinct immediately thinks Merlin. It's just two days after Merlin was disappeared. What's wrong with him.

"Why should be Merlin? Didn't you banish him away, did you? What? Are you starting to regret it?

Morgana's sarcastic words make him angry.

"What are you coming here for Morgana? Short to the point. I'm not that free."

"Of course you're not. Well then where is Merlin? Where he ran away?"

"I don't know."

"You cold blood evil. You know best why he suffered that way. He could have died. He didn't any slightest care his life to save you. What he got back?? Hmmm!! Lived shamefully as a girl and then was banished away like a stray dog. just because he's magic. You're not any less with your father, Arthur. I thought you're different. I was wrong."

"Stop it and get out Morgana. Though you're an high princess I won't give you exception. Insulting the King is kind of treason."

"Of course your majesty. I'll go. Oh so poor Merlin."

Morgana goes out and closes the door with a bang. Arthur closes his eyes and exhales his breath to calm himself. He doesn't know what are on his mind now. Everything is so complicated and bewildering. Arthur stands up from the chair and stroms out to the traing ground. Restless and hard works may cure his mind.

 

"Arthur. Did I hear wrong? Merlin was expelled? Why?"

As soon as he arrives at the ground Gawine strides toward Arthur and asks him continuously. Arthur doesn't know why Gawine know that. He didn't say a word about that.

"
