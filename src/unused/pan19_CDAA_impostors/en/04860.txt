replied modestly,"It's always good to be prepared."

After a few minutes of playing around and drinking water, it started to rain enough to make us retreat to our makeshift shelter. 

"Guess what!" I said. "Chicken butt!" Luner replied, snorting. I pouted, "No! look at our clothing! the puke washed off!"

"Phew!" Luner said, relived. "I did not think I was going to last much longer in that stuff!"

Then, as the adrenaline wore off we began to experience the consequences of our actions. 

"H-hey Luner w-was it always this cold??"

"N-no I don't think so"

Yay. Approaching hypothermia. One more thing to add to our long list of problems.

Crack!

Oh. It seems water has begun leaking through our roof.

"....."

"Welllllll.... This is one long chain of unfortunate events" I said, trying to break the ice.

But, Luner jut blankly looked at the rain falling before saying something nether of us wanted to hear, "I wonder how mom and dad are doing...."

I bit back tears threatening to fall, "D-dont mention them right now."

But, he continued. "I wonder if they are eating dinner? Do they miss us?"

"Stop it."

"What about old-man Tony? I miss cookies."

"Stop it!" I shouted, not wanting to hear this anymore. So, this it what it was like to get covered in questions. I will keep at mental note.

For the remaining night, we did not speak a single word to each other, curdled in a tight ball. Then, when I finally finally fell asleep, I had
terrible nightmares. Just my luck.

Day 1-end

Luna's POV_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Tweet!

Oh, it's the bird again. That's nice

Achoo! Oh, I caught a cold. That sucks.

Growl. Oh, I have not eaten anything not (poison?) in two days. Wonderful. Also, those leaf bundles Luner made are looking real nice right about now. Oh yeah, speaking of Luner, I guess I am just going to pretend I didn't hear anything last night. Problem solved.

Is this what people like to call......The shock setting in??? Well, let's just push aside us being abandoned in the woods for right now. Well, time to wake Luner up.

Tweet!

Oh, thanks bird. You saved me the trouble of waking him u-Oh, wait. Mr.Bird, your awfully close and looking pretty tasty over there.Well, I just happend to place a conveniently sharp stick next to me in case we got attacked during the night.... So... you know, Mr.Bird,right about now my attitude is kill or be killed.. you know what happens next. Oh! You found a nice tasty worm in the ground?!Well, whom am I to stop you from survival instincts! Heck, that's what i'm relying on right now. Another thing, Mr.Bird. I just happened to be an amazing reader so I have already read the first series of Warrior cats: Into the wild so, I know a thing or two. Oh, look! I'm downwind!Wow! I'm only 6 steps away from you, Mr.Bird. 3...2.... almost there...1! She shoots and she.... manages to hit the birds wing! 

So what if I talk to myself... Everybody has their flaws...

Shoot! It's running away! Better chase it.

tsk! I don't know where it landed..

Tweet! Well, well, well, Mr. Bird, are you in that bush over there? No? Well, how about right...HERE! Oh, Mr.Bird, you don't look too good.You know, If this were any other time, I would have picked you up and slowly nursed you back to health. But, to be frank, i'm desperate.So, Mr.Bird, sorry about about this. 

Then, I did the killing blow. Well, time to wake up Luner!

When I get back to camp, Luner is looking for me and calling my name. I can't wait to surprise him with breakfast!

"Hey Luner~" I called. His head shot towards the sound of the sound of my voice "Luna! I thought you were gone!" He sobbed, tears rollingdown his cheek. 

Then, he noticed what was in my hand. His face went pale. "W-what is that!?" "It's breakfast~!" I sang back. "N-no you don't understand...I-is that a dead bird?!"

"Haha, y-yep~!" I sang as tears started to gather in my long,dark
