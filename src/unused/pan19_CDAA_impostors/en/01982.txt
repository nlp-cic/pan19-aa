cheese, and brings it up to her room.

He knocks, "Zepp? Sweetheart, you should eat some dinner. I made you your favorite."

When the door is fully open, Dean sees it's totally empty. No one is in there and there are clothes missing.

Dean runs to the kitchen and drops the bowl off, running towards the door, grabbing his jacket and keys along the way.

He screams her name when he is outside and checks down both side of the roadway.

He has no idea where she went and Dean is terrified.

He gets in the Impala and drives, calling Cas and Sam on the way.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Zeppelin is so angry at her dad. He was being so mean!

She had decided she would try to see if she could get to Aunt Jodie's from where the bunker was. She didn't want to be there with her daddy, he was a doodoo-head.

The longer she walked though, the more she started realizing she had no idea where she was going, no idea how to even get back.

She walked along the road and tears started forming, she was cold and tired and scared. She didn't know where she was and she wanted her parents.

Zeppelin saw a small box on the side of the road, she looked inside and there was a baby puppy.

The dog looked up at her and whimpered, she called it over.

The puppy slowly walked towards her and when it got near enough, she picked it up.

"You don't have a home? You can come live with me and papa and daddy." Zeppelin frowned and tears welled up again, "If we ever get home."

Zeppelin heard a snap and she looked to the woods, someone was walking out of it.

The shadow spoke, "Hey, little girl. What's your name? Are you lost?"

The puppy whimpered and Zeppelin took a step back, her parents always told her to not talk to strangers...

"I can help you get back home. What's your name?"

"...Zeppelin..."

The person stopped for a second then walked right up to you, "Are you Zeppelin Winchester? Daughter of Dean and Castiel Winchester?"

Zeppelin took a step back, "H-How do you know them..."

She could see his face now, his grey eyes.

He turned them black and gave a wicked smile, "Oh, their good buddies of mine."

Zeppelin screamed and ran, clutching the dog to her chest.

She heard laughter from behind her, fueling her legs.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


"Yes Dean?'


"Zeppelin ran away, I'm out looking for her, I already called Sam to help look too.


'Why did she run away?!'


Dean cringed at his husbands harsh tone, "I sorta yelled at her and sent her to her room without supper and grounded her from TV for a week." Dean swerved from where he was going onto the other lane.


'Dean Winchester I swear to my father, if my baby is hurt I will smite you.'


"I'm out looking now. But you should look too. We'll find her baby. She couldn't gotten far, she's on foot."

The phone hung up, Dean stepped on the accelerator harder, praying to a God he doesn't believe in that his daughter is alright.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Zeppelin ran hard, breathing ragged and short. She was tired but she didn't know what was chasing her and she was scared and just wanted to be wrapped in her daddy's arms again. He was warm, safe.

Zeppelin tripped and ripped her pants, scraping her knees. She got back up quickly and ran again.

She heard a car that sounded very familiar and when the headlights came into view she started crying, her daddy would make it better, he could make the scary man go away. s]She kept running.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Dean saw a tiny figure running, a taller one behind it, gaining on the smaller figure.

When he realized it was his daughter he slammed on the breaks and threw it in park.

Grabbing the demon knife and his gun, he threw open the door and ran.

He ran past his daughter and shot the figure, it didn't slow.

He pulled out the knife and ran head first. He got up close to it and realized it was a demon. He quickly stabbed it, making it glow.

"Don't try to ever go after my daughter, bitch."

He dropped the body and turned around, running to his daughter and scooping her up.

"Don't you ever leave like that again! I was so scared baby girl. Everyone was scared. I'm so glad you're okay, I'm sorry baby girl, I'm so sorry."

Dean felt her tears on his skin of his neck, he stood up and walked to the car, "I'm sorry daddy. I shouldn't have ran away.. That man was so scary daddy. He knew you and papa and he was chasing me. I
