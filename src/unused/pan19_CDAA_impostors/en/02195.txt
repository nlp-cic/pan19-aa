Fuck your mother in the ear, fuckboy! You skinny-assed fool!)



PART IV: Sexy Earthquakes


Redecorated.
We used to have a mirror
But now we have shards.

Shake it up for me
Break the bed, shake the armoire
Show me you want it




PART V: Howe drunk are we?


There once was a warden named Anders
Whose conduct was utterly scand'lous (FUCK YOU IT RHYMES IF YOU'RE DRUNK)

He fucked off on the job
To get on my knob
But wound up stuck on the Commander's

An archer shoots straight
At least until he is drunk
Don't ask why, but Howe.

I lay with a mage in my bunk
Both of his hands were fondling my junk
I decided to bugger
The insolent fucker
And fuck you it rhymes if you're drunk.

It takes a brave soul
To climb up on my flagpole
Brave or just stupid.

Your fucking enormous flagpole
Did terrible things to my hole
But I'm not a monk
And if you get me drunk
You can still join me in my bedroll

You could have said 'please'.
How many drinks does it take
'Til you're on your knees?

No less than seven drinks drunk
If you're wanting to get in my bunk
So pull down your skirt
Before you get hurt
You slutty, outrageous, mage punk.




PART VI: Hot Hawke-on-Hawke... What the fuck is this even?


So I am a young mage named Artie
My booty knows just how to party
I have a brother, in fact,
Whose name is Cormac,
And another whose dog is quite farty.

And I am the oldest of five
Quite lucky to be yet alive
Went charging through space
Took a hit in the face
From an ogre, 'cause that's how I thrive

...I'm surrounded by morons, you see.
By rights, I should be one of three.
Between Cormac's face,
And Carver's disgrace,
How unlucky can one family be?

Your problem's you look at my face
Which isn't my relevant grace
But look at my shoulders
They're bigger than boulders
And then get the fuck off my case

You want me to 'fuck off' you say?
Maker knows I've been drinking all day.
I'll go find Fenris
And give him a kiss
While you can kiss my boot-ey.

Go and enjoy your elven 'culture'
Which you circle around like a vulture
But, if he breaks your knee
Don't come crying to me
Him with a mage? I'd be shocked

(IT RHYMES. BUT ONLY IF YOU KNOW ... 'culture'.)



Cormac, stop being a dick!
Do those shields make your brain extra thick?
Go mope by yourself.
I'll get groped by my elf
And try to make Carver shit bricks.

If I were a dick, you'd be fucked
Your pants 'round your knees would be rucked
Your drunk 'Pull of the Dicks'
Would have left you no slick
And I'd be in your ass firmly tucked

We both know that's your wishful thinking
And that's why you're sitting here drinking
Instead of downstairs
On top of Anders
As you stare at my ass without blinking.

You know I'm not into your ass
Whatever you seek with this sass
If you want me to throb
Come and give me your knob
And I'll scream while you shatter the glass

Really now, Cormac, take care.
Your talking is getting some stares.
You'll just have to wait,
You damned reprobate
(But tell me more when we're upstairs).

Oh, down to the cellar let's go
And give Anders a bit of a show
On his knob you can drool
As he starts to unspool
Leaves your elf in the dark a bit though

Stairs will be tricky this drunk.
Descending might end with a thunk.
Let's invite the elf!
He's all by himself!
If it's dark, we can see by his junk!

If we're in need of a glowstick
We could always use Anders's dick
But, that brings up the spirit
Not sure we'll get near it
'Cause Justice is kind of a prick

I'm not sure we'd do Anders justice.
By which I mean Anders's Justice.
Or would Justice do you?
I guess that would do.
Would you mind if it didn't end bloodless?

Would I mind if it ended in blood?
Are we talking a spurt or a flood?
You can rip me apart
Just don't tear out my heart
While my Hawke ass gets ploughed by that stud

How could I tear out your heart?
Isn't that Fenris's part?
Or yours, I guess.
With your hand in my chest,
Could you so sweetly tear me apart?

You want me to glow in the dark?
Oh wouldn't that be a lark
But we're gonna get stuck
Between fucking and fucked
Since it's all or it's none of me sparks

On second thought, how about no.
There are so many ways
