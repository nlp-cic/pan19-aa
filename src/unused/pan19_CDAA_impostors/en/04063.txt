you,When you get worried I'll be your soldier. I'll be your soldierWell I'll be, oh I'll be your soldierI'll be your soldierI'll be your soldier  Cas and Dean both hugged Charlie when she jumped off the stage. Dean kissed the top of her head “Thanks kid, that means a lot” Dean said. Cas hugged her too his side and whispered “Thanks bestie.Guess I owe you some serious snackage for that.” She lightly punched him and said “You know it.” They heard a rustling and looked up at the stage. Cole had moved from his silent position at a table to sitting down with a guitar on stage. Everyone looked equally shocked and sat down too. Cole cleared his throat a few times and then quietly spoke into the mic “Well, if Charlie is your fighter, I’m that guy that seems to be ‘round to catch you when one of you idiots thinks it's a good idea to bale. She’s right though, what you have is special and I can tell you, you don’t always get that chance a second time. Anyway, I’m a man of a few words but seeing as it's your anniversary and all, just know.. If you need someone to catch you I’m around.” Cole didn’t cue up the karaoke machine. He just began to play a song on his guitar. No one even knew he could play, but sure enough, he could and he did. Then he sang in his slight twang.

Street lights along the highwayThrowing shadows in the darkAnd the memories keep on turningTo the rhythm of a broken heart You only need a roof when it's rainingYou only need a fire when it's coldYou only need a drink when the whiskeyIs the only thing that you have left to holdSun comes up and goes back downAnd falling feels like flying till you hit the groundSay the word and I'll be there for youI will be your parachuteParachute There's a song that I rememberI never learned to playAnd a lifetime of forgotten wordsI never got to say You only need a roof when it's rainingYou only need a fire when it's coldYou only need a drink when the whiskeyIs the only thing that you have left to holdSun comes up and goes back downAnd falling feels like flying till you hit the groundSay the word and I'll be there for youI will be your parachuteParachute If you think you're going downJust know I will be around You only need a roof when it's rainingYou only need a fire when it's coldYou only need a drink when the whiskeyIs the only thing that you have left to holdSun comes up and goes back downAnd falling feels like flying till you hit the groundSay the word and I'll be there for youI will be yourI will be your parachuteParachute He set the guitar down and inclined his head to the couple. Dean inclined his head back and lifted his glass. Cas mouthed a thank you as Cole went back to sitting where he was sipping his beer. Cas nearly jumped out of his skin as a voice behind him said “Please for the love of god, tell me you have signed that man.” Cas mopped up the sloshed liquor he has spilled onto the table and turned abruptly in his seat. “Damnit Crowley. Do you just appear out of thin air when you hear a good artist?” Crowley smiled widely, sat down and propped his foot up on another seat “Naturally, don’t we all? Oh stop giving me that look. I was in the neighborhood, dropping of the girls contracts and decided to get a drink. Is that a crime?” Cas shook his head “I’ll look into it in the morning Crowley, it’s my anniversary, so I ain’t doin’ shit tonight, except my husband.” Dean grinned lasciviously at Crowley “And he plans on doing a whole lot of that tonight” Crowley set his feet back on the ground and looked annoyed “Charming. Well, okay. Call me if you ever actually feel like working again Castiel. I’ll be in touch. Oh, and Dean, it appears I do actually have an anniversary gift after all.” He pulled a magazine out of his inside pocket in his suit and laid it flat. “Your beautiful voice just hit slot #3 on the billboard's top 20. Everyone loves it. Zar doesn’t know whether he wants to kill you or have your babies.” Crowley laughed out loud at his joke. Dean looked at the paper stunned then he looked at Cas. Cas smiled and said “Well Winchester, looks like I’ll have to protect you from paparazzi now.” He kissed him but then pulled back and said “But I swear to god, if you turn into some self absorbed ego maniac.. I’ll shoot you my damn self” Dean started laughing “I think you can pretty much count on that not happening and Crowley tell Zar his Diva position is secure.That last tour away from Cas was the hardest thing I have done in a very long time
