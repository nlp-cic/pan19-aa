the past. These were the virtues Simon Blackquil had chosen to emulate.

It was really hard to do so when Athena was bouncing vigorously on top of him, but damn if he wasn’t going to try. His mind struggled to put together enough coherent thoughts to develop an impressive poem. He was so close… going for it! 

“Like cherry blossomsYour love always makes me say….OH FUCK I’M COMING!”

Athena slowed to a stop, looking down at him with a mixture of disbelief and hilarity. “Did you… did you actually just do that?”

“Er…”

She leaned in next to his ear. 

“Holding onto youWhen your passion peaks in meLike late summer rain.”

Simon made a strangled noise as, in defiance of all probability and bodily law, he fired off again. One last thought bubbled up from the destroyed remnants of his mind as unconsciousness rose to claim him. 

I have been bested… my honor is as shredded as my loins… 

~~~~~~~~

Athena may have been easy to embarrass, but damn if she wasn’t an absolute shrew when she got the upper hand on him. And one of the downsides of dating someone you worked with was that it made them very hard to avoid.

Why this file required hand delivery to the Wright Anything Agency, he wasn’t entirely sure, but he did know that the gigantic grin on Athena’s face as she waved him in could only bode poorly. “Cykes-dono… I’m just here to drop this off…”

“I hope it’s writtenMore aptly than the haikuYou wrote as you came.” 

Simon looked at her, mouth agape. “Did… did you just…”

She grinned wider in response.“Oh proud samuraiTried to write a poem pureAnd yet, you SO failed.

I am much betterAt poeticizing thusLeave it to me, fool.”

Simon looked from her to Justice, who was studiously pretending to ignore them at his desk. “I… this is not the appropriate…”

“What black-coated manAttempted to be suaveBut came in my hair?

I prefer hair gelComing from a tube or tubBut thanks anyway.”

The demoness tossed a huge wink at Justice, who groaned. 

“It is not my fault your hair is everywhere…” Simon began, but Athena was sashaying around the office, practically singing her next lines.

“What a magic trickToo bad I caught you at itAsk a Gramarye.”

On the couch, Trucy dissolved into giggles. Simon could feel his face flushing hotter by the second.

Wright himself appeared from his office, clamping his hands firmly over his daughter’s ears. He raised one eyebrow at Simon.

“Kindly refrain fromCorrupting my poor daughterJeez, Blackquill, come on.”

A strangled noise of outraged protest tried to force its way out of his throat, but Athena interrupted him.

“He just must admitThat he needs to practice moreSilly samurai!”

There was another groan from Justice’s direction. 

“Can we all just stopTalking about your sex lifeIn haiku format?”

He looked beseechingly at Athena, who pouted for a moment before perking up. 

“In verse shall I discuss our coital forms?Astride atop my man I was that night,As forceful as a gallop ‘cross the glade,Alack! ‘Twould that the ride had lasted moreThan minutes barely mounting to a score!”

Simon buried his face in his hands. Across the room, Justice said exactly what he was thinking.

“What world is this in which I live and breatheSuch that this demon works each day with me?”

~~~~~~~~

And it just didn’t stop. In court…

“Without evidenceYour argument is baselessYou naughty boy toy.”

At lunch…

“Good to see that youAre practicing with that tongueI have use for it.”

As he practiced his swordsmanship…

“Would that both your bladesWere wielded with such prowessGirl’s got needs, y’know?”

It grew so absolutely intolerable, Simon decided that there was only one thing for it: vengeance. 

~~~~~~~~

They were naked again, rolling around in his apartment. Athena was beneath him, somehow still giggling as he did his best to drive all conscious thought from her mind. 

“Your exertions areQuite forceful—ah!—but they lack some…Imagination.”

He growled, edging closer. 

“Holding onto youWhen your passion peaks ‘round me…

The growl rose in intensity as he reached his peak, bringing with it the final line, whispered in her ear.

“Dick aneurysm.”

She froze, absolutely motionless as he pulled away, moving off the bed to stretch. His smirk was more self-satisfied than usual. 

“Did…” she began, seemingly lost for words. “Did you just quote that galloping abs thing at me?!”

He raised an eyebrow at her.

“And if I didYour reaction was worth it…”

A flick of his wrist brought the sunglasses lying on his bedside table to his face.

“You may deal with it.”

“YEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAH!” Klavier Gavin burst forth from his hiding place in the closet, knee-sliding across the floor as his guitar ripped out the power chords.

Athena looked from her boyfriend to the rockstar on the floor who had somehow managed to knee slide across carpet. 

“
