mean.. Liam!” Zayn croaked, the end of ‘Liam’ cracking.

“Who is i.. Dad?” Liam asked getting closer to the pair.

“Liam.” God said. “What are you. What are you doing here?” Liam asked grabbing Zayn’s arm and letting his father enter.

“I came for a surprise. Expecting me to come tomorrow, no.” God said walking inside and eyeing everything.

“Zayn!” Liam whispered yelled.

“Huh?” Zayn asked, eyes wide staring at God himself.

“Go put a shirt own for Christ’s sake!” Liam said and Zayn looked down to find himself topless.

“Shit, right!” Zayn said running off.

“Dad.. Umm. You told me tomorrow. We didn’t, we’re not ready, or um we. You could’ve told me.” Liam said following his dad as he suspected the house, petting his long white beard.

“I don’t like him.” His father said unsuspectingly.

“What? You didn’t, you didn’t even give him a chance.” Liam whimpered.

“I don’t need to Liam. He’s a devil. They are rude, cruel, the complete opposite of what we are.” God reminded.

“But father. He’s not like that. He’s sweet, and he cares and loves me. I’m sorry, you know I’m never one to break the rules or go against your words but if I love him, I’m staying with him. ” Liam dejected.

“Then, you will be relived from your angel duties.” His father sighed.

“What… You mean if I don’t dump Zayn I can’t be an angel anymore?” Liam asked astonished.

“What?” A sweet voice popped behind Liam. He turned and found Zayn in one of Liam’s plaid shirt because all of his are black, dirty, or inappropriate. “You can’t do that,” Zayn said walking up to them, “You can’t. That’s like taking away his dignity. And his personality and everything that he is. Being an Angel is a reason why I fell in love with him. Not that I wouldn’t love him if he wasn’t, just that being an Angel is part of him. And, and you can’t take that away!” Zayn yelled.

Liam’s mouth was a gaped. “Zayn..” He whispered quietly.

“No. You are not gonna be a human just because you love someone!” Zayn protested, facing Liam now.

“Relax.” Liam smiled.

Zayn leaped into Liam’s arms, holding him tight. “Please don’t throw me away. I know I’m supposed to be evil Li. But, but.. B-But. I’ve ch-changed for you. Don’t throw me away to be an Angel. Because you’ll still be my Angel.” Zayn whispered.

“I would never. I’m still an Angel. I cant be mean if I tried.” Liam said and looked at his dad.

“Maybe you should leave.” Liam said.

“Whoa!,” Zayn said hoping out of Liam, “You cant just say that to God!”

“He’s my dad, I can say what I want.” Liam shrugged off.

“Liam, I’m warning you.” God said calmly.

“No. I’m warning you. To back off of my life. Being an Angel has no significance to me, dad. We’ll get married one day! And you cant stop that!” Liam yelled.

“Married?” His dad sputtered.

“Yes dad. It’s what people do when they love each other.” Liam rolled his eyes.

God looked towards Zayn. “If you marry my son, you’ll be in the biggest trouble ever.” He huffed before walking out.

“Jesus Christ..” Zayn whispered. He looked around for Liam. “Liam? Baby?” Zayn asked around the house.

“Right here.” He heard Liam purr from behind him. He turned around and.. Holy shit.

"What are you wearing?” Zayn asked but he’s pretty sure his mouth was watering.

Liam was shirtless, and pants less. He had red underwear on with green lacing. Plus a headband with reindeer antlers on them and a red nose that clowns usually use.

“You wanted me a Christmas whore, didn’t you? After my father left?” Liam asked, smirking and running into the bedroom. Successfully locking the door, and giggling when Zayn groaned.

“OPEN THIS DOOR!” Zayn gruffed.

“No!” Liam giggled. Zayn frowned, and his eyes turned kind of red. He slashed out and popped into the room. Liam gasped from against the door. Zayn’s hands balled into fists.

Liam knew he was angry, but would never hurt Liam. And.. It turned Liam on so much when Zayn took control.

Zayn grabbed Liam by the shoulders and pushed him
