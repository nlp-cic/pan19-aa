again."

"Why do you think he wanted to know?"

"I have no idea, but he always has a reason.  And they're usually pretty shady."

"Maybe he was just making conversation?"

"Do you really believe that, Bruce?"

"No, but what's the alternative?"

"Probably nothing good.  I just wish I knew what he really wanted."

"Well, I give you and JARVIS permission to hack SHIELD to you heart's content, but right now we need to sleep," Bruce urged.

Tony nodded his agreement, and snuggled into Bruce's side, trying to not worry about it long enough to sleep.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It turns out that Tony didn't have to hack anything, because Fury called them the next morning shortly after they returned to the Tower from dropping Jane off at school.

"Sir, there's an incoming call from Director Fury," JARVIS informed.

"Put him through," Tony instructed.

"Good morning, Stark.  Is Banner there?" Fury greeted brusquely.

"I'm here," Bruce said, moving so he was standing next to Tony.

"Good, I need to talk to you both."

"Before you do, what was with all the questions about our family planning last night," Tony broke in.

"That's why I called.  SHIELD responded to an incident at an OsCorp lab a few nights ago.  A want-to-be super-villain tried to steal something, and in the process killed several scientists, including both parents of a young two-year-old boy," Fury explained.

"Wait, are you asking us to adopt him?" Tony asked incredulously.  "When did SHIELD get into the adoption business?"

"We're not, but there are, special circumstances," he said carefully.  "He was in the lab during the attack, and he hid behind the enclosure where they were keeping the spiders that they were using in an experiment on radiation exposure.  One of the spiders bit him.  And there have been, well, side-effects."

"What do you mean side-effects?" Bruce asked.

"Climbing up walls, shooting webs, impossibly fast reflexes.  At least that's what we've seen so far," Fury explained. "I think you can appreciate why we don't want just anyone to adopt him."

"Why us?" Tony asked.

"Three months ago I would have never even considered you.  But I've been watching you with your daughter, and you're very good parents.  Stable, responsible, and caring.  Things I never would have thought it was possible for Stark to be-"

"Hey!"

"-The point is, you're exactly what he needs.  A stable, loving home.  And it doesn't hurt that Dr. Banner understands firsthand what it's like to have your life transformed by a lab accident," Fury said honestly, which was a bit unnerving, because he was never honest.

"We need to talk to Jane first," Bruce spoke up.  "We just finished adopting her.  She might not be ready for a little brother."

"Bruce is right.  We need to think about her first," Tony agreed.

"Let me know once you've decided," he said, signing off the call.

Tony and Bruce stared at each other for a long moment.

"Did he just offer to give us a super-powered toddler?" Tony asked in disbelief.

"That's what I heard," Bruce confirmed, still not believing it himself.

"Okaaaaay."

"Now what?" Bruce asked nervously.

"Like you said, we talk to Jane.  And if she's okay with it, then we bring the kid home with us," Tony said matter-of-factly.

"You're okay with bringing another child into our family?  Even though Jane's only lived with us for three months?"

"Technically, she's lived with you for four months, even if the first month was in a prison cell captured by terrorists.  And, of course I'm okay with it.  It might not be ideal, but neither was the way we added Jane to our family.  We might just specialize in adopting kids under weird circumstances.

This boy needs someone, Bruce.  And tell me, who would love him more than we would?"

"We still need to talk to Jane first."

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

That afternoon they picked up Jane from school and brought her to the diner to talk.

"Jane, your daddy and I need to talk to you," Tony said seriously, after they ordered.

She seemed slightly nervous when she heard his serious tone, but she nodded her head that he should continue.

"How would you feel about being a big sister?" Tony asked.

"A big sister?" Jane questioned.  "I didn't think two daddies could have babies."

Tony quickly brought a hand to his mouth to cover his laugh, and Bruce took over the conservation.

"We can't, but you know how we became your daddies?" he asked
