her bed and looked under the bed.

A deep blue stone locket was underneath it.

She picked it up and thought of where it came from but when she opened it the little girl closed it again instantly.
Lilith then knew what the locket was. It was her star... It had somehow changed into that locket. But she knew it was her star.
The girl held the locket infront of her eyes. It was a very pretty locket made of deep blue stone that was shiny and sleek.

She reached her drawer in her nightstand and took out a small box.
It was a normal looking box made of brown cartboard with the child made letter on the top that read: "Lilith's Box, Hands Off!"
The girl opened it and revealed inside several colourful pieces of fabric and roles of multi-coloured strings all jumbled up.

She took out a long yellow wollen string and closed the box again, and put it back in the drawer. Then she inserted the wollen string through the hole on the top of the locket and gave a knot with the two ends.
Now it was a locket she could carry around her neck.

Lilith smiled.
But it somehow felt forced because of the screaming voice in her head...

Months had passed since the earthquake happened. The summer was now ending and the warm days were getting colder and shorter, some trees had began to turn from green to orange, red or plain brown. The children were no longer wearing t-shirts and shorts, now they wore sweaters and long throusers or skirts with tights underneath them.

Lilith was wearing a red sweater with the number six in it, with gray trousers and orange rainboots. She had her locket over her sweater and in her hands there was a rake.

She was currently grounded for fighting with another kid at the home.
She scratched her nose, the bandaid above it was really itchy. Aswell as all the other scabs she had from the rest of her cuts and scrapes. Lilith had raked most of the leaves that had already fallen from the trees from the backyard when the governess had appeared at the back door.

-" Lilith! Come inside. "- she told the girl.

No questions asked, Lilith dropped the rake where she stood and ran back to the house.
Inside the other children were either watching television, playing board games or reading books. Not even one of them glanced at Lilith when she entered the house.
They had been like that since the earthquake...

-" You can help Mrs. Willow in the kitchen before you go upstairs to your room. "- the governess told her.

Mrs. Willow was a new cook at the home. The last one retired after the earthquake because "she was getting too old for it", so they had spent a few weeks with new cooks day in and day out.
Those weeks the meals had been so contrasting that some children begged the governess to call for pizzas.

Lilith entered the kitchen, Mrs. Willow was near the stove stirring a saucepan which was steaming. When she saw Lilith she gave a grunt of aknowledgement and pointed to a table where there were eggs and bowls.
The girl walked towards the table, sat on the stool that was underneath the table. She cracked the eggs and started to mix them and added a bit of salt. After Mrs. Willow had arrived Lilith had learned how to cook or atleast help around the kitchen.

Unfortunately to the woman, as she seemed to hate Lilith.
The woman was short with brown hair and brown eyes. Her nose was pointy and her lips were always tightly closed together, there were some warts on her face and her brows were always frowned.
She didn't like Lilith one bit as she desperately tried to have her sent to another home, one for troubled youths, but to no avail as the governess assured the cook she couldn't give up on the girl yet.

It was all so annoying... Being treated as a diseased being.

-' But you are you know... '- a voice spoke inside Lilith -' A monster, I mean.'

-' Shut it! '- Lilith told it -' I don't have time for you!'

-' Oh, why not? '- the voice asked -' You're grounded to leave the house... What better time do you have to hear me?'

-' You got me into trouble again! '- Lilith hissed to the voice -' I hate you!'

-' You hate yourself? '- the voice asked -' I only tell you want you truly think, not some lies you keep telling yourself!'

-' They are not lies! '- Lilith yelled inside her head -' And you will leave me alone!'

-' Or else? '- the voice asked, mockingly.

-" I'll ripe you to shreds! "- Lilith bellowed.

-" WHAT DID YOU SAY?! "- Mrs. Willow yelled from behind Lilith.

-" Nothing that matters to you! "- Lilith told the woman.

-" UPSTAIRS! "- the woman yelled again -" MRS. GLENN!"

Lilith ran upstairs, reached her bedroom and closed the door behind her.
She jumped on top of her bed and closed her eyes, burrowing her face in her pillow.
