.  Obedience.”

Jim's lip curled.  “Gratitude?  Obedience??  He kidnapped me.  He's imprisoned me.  And he wants gratitude??”

Sam nodded, his eyes wide and sad.  “Yes.  For everything.  For everything he gives you.  For water, for food, for the blanket, for the use of the bathroom.  Everything.”  Sam paused.  “You'll hear me... thank him for using me.”

“Using you?!  Using you for what??”

“Sexually.  It... it would be rape, except... you can't rape a toy.”  Sam tested the weight of the words on his tongue.

Jim looked appalled.  “That's fucking twisted, man.  You're not a toy.  I don't even know what you mean by that.  But you gotta get out of here.  We gotta get out of here.”

Sam shook his head, a small, sad smile on his lips.  “There's no getting out.  All there is is... minimizing the pain.  Following the rules.  And hoping he lets you go.”

Jim stared.  “You're serious.”

Sam nodded.  “Yeah.  I'm... I'm really sorry this happened to you.  I don't know why Dean's doing this, but I'm sorry that he picked you.  I wish I could help you.  All I can tell you is to follow the rules.  Don't, whatever you do, antagonize him.  Don't even talk, unless he tells you to.  It's safer, trust me.  The last time I... spoke out of turn, he... put a bullet in me, and then five in my friend.”

Jim's eyes widened, and he scanned Sam's body for evidence of  injury.  “But... you're not hurt.”

“That's... a little complicated to explain.  My friend - Dean is holding him prisoner, too – his name is Castiel, and he's...”  Sam wasn't sure what to say that wouldn't make Jim think he was stark raving mad.  “He has healing powers.  If you're good, really good, sometimes Dean will allow Cas to heal you.”

“What in the sweet fuck are you talking about?  That's not... a real thing.”  Jim looked completely baffled.

“It is, in this room.”

“No.  No way is that true.”

“Look, kid, do you want the truth?”  Sam was a little exasperated.

“Yes!”

Sam resigned himself to explaining to the kid that monsters were real, and that Dean was one of them.  Explaining about demons and angels, Knights of Hell and terrible curses.  He was certain that Jim would think him crazy, but at least the kid should know the truth about what was going to be happening to him.

Dean grinned at Castiel.  “His name is Jim.  Pretty little thing.  Nineteen.”

Dread grew in Castiel's stomach.

“Him and Sam are making friends right now.  I'm betting Sam's just begging him to behave.  As if the kid's behaviour has anything to do with how this is gonna go down.”

“Dean, please.  Please.  Do not do this.”  Castiel's eyes were wide, pleading.

“It's already done, Cas.”  Dean cocked his head.  “Did you want to see it happen?”

No, of course not... but if I am there, there's a chance I could help.  “Yes.”

“We'll see.  I'm still trying to decide how this'll go, to maximize the pain for Sammy.  I suppose having you there might be... helpful, in that regard.”

Fear clawed at Castiel's insides.

Dean left without saying anything further.

Sam was reasonably sure that he had blown Jim's mind with his explanations.  Jim certainly looked it.  Both of them were quiet for a time.

The boy's stomach rumbled.  Sam understood only too well.  “Does he feed you?  Will he feed me?”

Sam nodded, his eyes downcast.  “If you're good.  Food is a privilege, like everything else is here.  It never seems to be enough, though.  Or often enough.”

“Probably wants to keep you weak, so you can't escape.”  Jim opined.

“Maybe.  He's got lots of ways of ensuring that won't happen.”

The door opened.

Dean grinned at both of them, sitting on opposite sides of the room.  “How y'all getting along?  Friends, I hope?”

Neither answered him.

“Sam?”  A hint of warning in Dean's voice.

“Yes... yes, Dean, we're friends.”  Sam responded quickly.

“Perfect.”  Dean gloated.  “So, let's play the 'Who's Getting Fucked' game.”

Sam stiffened, and he saw Jim's eyes widen with fear.

“Jim.  Jimmy.  You like guys?”  Dean turned to
