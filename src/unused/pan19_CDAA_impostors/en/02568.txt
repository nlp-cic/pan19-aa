into the wet heat. But he had better things planned, so he gently pulled the boy back, smiling as he whined in protest.

-It is my turn to taste you, love. – Harry stared at him wide eyed as Tom pulled him up to his feet. His lips brushed lightly along the underside of Harry's erection, causing the younger man's knees to weaken slightly. Tom smiled, cupping Harry's backside for support, pressing open mouthed kisses down his length.

Harry began to tremble lightly, his hands twisting into Tom's hair and clenching convulsively. His thoughts started to blur around the edges, all he could focus on was how hot Tom's lips were, and how desperately he wanted them wrapped around him. Unexpectedly he got his wish, gasping sharply and then promptly bending over Tom's head and moaning so loud it was nearly a shout. He was suddenly completely buried in Tom's mouth, the hot wetness tightening and moving over his length.

"T-Tom! Oh, Merlin, Tom…please, fuck me!" Tom's head pulled away immediately, and then they were pulled into the gut wrenching feeling of disapparation.

Harry landed on the bed first, closely followed by the weight of his lover settling on top of him. It was sudden and over whelming and utterly blissful. Tom's body completely covered his, bearing down on every inch of exposed skin and blossoming into beautiful heated pleasure. His moistened lips caressed his neck, the ridge of his collarbone, closed over one, and then the other nipple. Harry cried out, arching into his touch.

Tom couldn't keep his hands off of Harry, he wanted to touch every part of him, soak him up until they couldn't be separated. His hands smoothed over milky white thighs, parting them until his hand could nestle between them. He murmured softly against Harry's hip, his fingers becoming slick at once. His finger rubbed gently along the younger boy's entrance, sliding up to tease the sensitive spot right above, and then returning to his entrance, nearly slipping the tip of his finger inside, but not quite.

Harry almost jumped as Tom's wet finger touched such a private part of him. It felt so wonderfully naughty, and soon he was squirming with the sensation. He bore down on the pressure, whining softly when Tom teased him.

"P-please, Tom…" He gasped, moaning in relief as the finger slid inside of him. He expected it to hurt, but instead all he felt was a strange, wonderful sense of being filled. If his finger felt like this than what would his cock feel like? His body flushed with heat, and he whimpered desperately, bucking his hips onto the finger.

Tom began to move, rubbing along the inside of his lover. He added another, and then a third, too impatient to bother with stretching for too long. He savored the heat of Harry for a moment, and then curled his fingers deliberately, smirking as Harry cried out. His head snapped back, his fingers curling around the sheets. When his eyes opened, they locked on Tom and the look in them was so blatantly erotic that Tom pulled his fingers out and grabbed Harry's hips and flipped them both over, settling Harry onto his lap.

If Tom had had any patience at all, it was gone. Harry pushed himself up to his knees, spreading his legs invitingly. He peered down at Tom, almost innocent looking.

-Make me yours. – Tom growled, clutching Harry's hips and pressing the head of his cock into the heat of Harry's entrance. Harry shuddered, trying to buck down onto his erection. Tom held fast to him, staring at his green eyes intently.

-Say it. - Harry need not even ask what he meant.

-I love you. – Tom's fingers tightened, his eyes flashing.


-Again.-


-Tom, I love you. - Harry whimpered, rolling his hips down slightly, moaning as Tom slid a bit further into him. He gripped Tom's shoulders tightly,

-I need you inside me so bad, I love you, I love you, I love you. – Harry was gasping by the end of it. Tom's eyes closed with the sound of it, obsessed with hearing Harry say those words. He slid slowly inside of him, groaning deeply as he was sucked into Harry's heat.

It was as if the world stopped again, slowing around them as they become connected for the first time. Tom's hands dug into Harry's hips, breathing heavily. They were still once again, and then it was impossible to stay still.

Tom's hips jerked upward and Harry cried out, his eyes snapping open. Their eyes met, and it was as if they had never existed before that moment. Tom's hands guided Harry up and then down, starting a slow, burning rhythm. Moans fell like prayers from Harry's mouth, whispering Tom's name reverently as the
