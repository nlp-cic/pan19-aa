of the woman that had starred in her dreams of the last few years. 

She hurried to open the doors and almost dragged B’Elanna inside, heading straight for the bedroom. Without much resistance she put the sleeping woman in bed and tucked the covers around her. Kathryn couldn’t help herself and tenderly kissed B’Elanna’s forehead, wishing her ‘sweet dreams’. After that she sped to her own quarters in search of a very, very cold shower.

“If there’s nothing else? Very well. Dismissed everyone.” Kathryn smiled as her senior staff exited the briefing room. “B’Elanna?” The Chief Engineer turned back to her Captain with a questioning look on her face. As soon as the others had left the room, Kathryn swallowed.“Sleep well last night?” B’Elanna cocked her head a little. “Captain?” 

Kathryn pursed her lips in an attempt to hide her smile. “I ran into you last night.” At B’Elanna’s frown she elaborated. “Apparently you were sleepwalking.” A surprised look adorned the Klingon’s features. “Really?” She paused pensively. “I haven’t done that since I was ten. At least, I think I haven’t…” Smiling reassuringly, Kathryn put her hand on B’Elanna’s arm. “Just report to Sickbay and let the Doctor monitor your sleeping cycle tonight. With a little luck he might find out why the sleepwalking is resurfacing.”

B’Elanna eyed the monitoring device the Doctor had given her and pursed her lips. She’d have to ‘forget’ to put it on tonight; otherwise her ruse would be detected in no time. Maybe if she claimed to have fallen asleep on her couch, she could get away with it. But it probably would work only once. Ah well, in the mean time, she would have had her fun. A lopsided grin appeared on her face as she remembered how great Kathryn had smelled when she had nuzzled her neck.

“Captain Janeway has left her quarters.” The Computer woke B’Elanna out of her slumber. She bolted upright and chuckled as she realized she really had dozed off on her couch. She quickly got up, put on her pajamas and ruffled her hair. “Computer, locate Captain Janeway.”“Captain Janeway is in turbolift four.” Came the neutral reply. “What’s the destination of that turbolift?” She hoped Kathryn wasn’t headed for the Messhall. Because there was no way she was going to sleepwalk in the Messhall wearing those very short pajamas. “Turbolift four is heading to Deck thirteen.” B’Elanna smiled. Apparently she would be sleepwalking on Deck thirteen tonight…

Aha, there she was. B’Elanna took a deep breath and began her impression of a sleepwalker. She trailed her hand against the walls again and made shuffling noises with her feet so that Kathryn would definitely hear her. It worked. From the corners of her eyes she saw the Captain turn and notice her. She could barely suppress her delight as she saw Kathryn approach. 

Tonight she was going to take it a little further. She would boldly go where no one on this ship had ever gone before. The brave B’Elanna Torres, Chief Engineer of the U.S.S. Voyager, was going to try to kiss the great Captain Kathryn Janeway. And she could hardly wait. This was probably as close to Kathryn as she was ever going to get. It had taken her long enough to devise this strategy. There was almost no way it could go wrong.

Kathryn sighed as she approached her Chief Engineer. She really didn’t think she could handle a repeat of the previous night. The cold shower hadn’t helped at all and her dreams had been extremely… eh… vivid. She slowly walked alongside B’Elanna, not trusting herself to touch the other woman. But there was no alternative, was there? She wasn’t very inclined to wake her up, and she couldn’t exactly leave her alone. That left her with guiding her back to her quarters.Unless…Unless she just followed her around and made sure B’Elanna didn’t hurt herself. Eventually she would lie down and sleep anyway, right? She backed up a little and watched B’Elanna move around.

B’Elanna had to use every ounce of willpower she possessed not to look behind her. Where was Kathryn? Why was she not leading her back to her quarters? Surely she hadn’t left her here alone, prone to the many dangers that lurked around every corner, which could cause serious injuries to the average sleepwalker? Just as she was about to give up her play and look back, she heard a shuffling sound behind her and a muffled cough that was unmistakably the Captain’s. 

So she hadn’t abandoned her. But then what the hell was she doing? This wasn’t part of the Master Plan of B’Elanna Torres! And what on Earth was she supposed to do now? Endlessly walk through the corridors on Deck thirteen
