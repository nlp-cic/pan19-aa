it...

Dean suddenly felt Sam tense next to him, and he found focus once more on his brother's face. Sam's brow was again wrinkled in response to some internal stress. The elder brother tried to smooth the lines, but Sam was deep in whatever worry the manticore had given him. Dean settled for resting his hand on the back of Sam's neck, hoping Sam could at least sense his presence. He looked at Claire again. "I tossed a whole bottle of holy oil on it, but while I was realizing I didn't have a damned light, the manticore took off." His eyes searched hers, hoping Claire would understand what he was telling her. "No matches. It was a rookie mistake. I'm no rookie."

"And I am." Claire supplied.

"Yeah," Dean agreed. "And now that fugly bastard knows I'm coming; and that I know how to kill it. And me being 'a little sidetracked' don't have nothing on if I'm actually zapped into the manticore's game at will. We'll be sitting ducks. If you go with me, YOU'LL be sitting ducks, and I can't let that happen."

"We're going. But we're going to be ducks who bring matches." Claire's tone was final. Rookie or not, she was going with Dean. "Stop beating yourself up you moron. We're going to end this."

Jody nodded. "…so. A plan."

And then she and Claire went limp.

The instant Sam materialized within the cage his heart rate skyrocketed. Not again. Not this. Not here. But…it wasn't. It wasn't the cage of his memories; not completely. This cage was different. The heat was as intense as ever, and the monster who'd brought him here stretched and basked in its perverted radiance. The smell of sulfur and the sound of screams remained, but his one-time companions were not in evidence. No Adam, no Lucifer, no Michael filled the grotesque confines of the cage. As it was on the beach, once again Sam was alone with the manticore. 



The beast looked around, considering. "As I said, you have some interesting and unpleasant things in that mind of yours. This place is loud and noxious, but appropriate for our next challenge. And it is warm." Purr, purr. "You humans don't appreciate proper weather. Any time the temperature gets above half reasonable you complain. Look at you." It gestured with its front paw, its scaled tail swishing in annoyance. "Sweating already. So disgusting. To be wet all the time." 



It tracked toward Sam as it spoke, backing the man into a corner and sitting back on its haunches before him. 



"You have ten friends. Around you, you will see 100 locked boxes, each numbered 1-100. Each of your friends will have a key, for a total of ten. Inside each of the boxes will be a card, with a single word written on it." 



Sam struggled to hear and remember the details, but his head filled with the memories this setting forced to the fore. He heard the manticore over a cacophony of screams, between flashbacks of terror unimaginable to any who hadn't experienced it. And now his loved ones were arriving in this place he would not wish any save Lucifer to see. Jody and Claire arrived first, with Garth, Ash, Rufus and Kevin right behind. The manticore considered, pausing, before materializing Sarah, Lisa, and Ben, who had grown taller than Sam remembered as he reached his teen years. Last, twisting the knife, the manticore brought Charlie from her rest in heaven. Sam staggered to see her in this place. 



Oblivious—or more likely indifferent—to Sam's inability to concentrate, the monstrous feline continued explaining its riddle. "Each of the lockers will open and close to my commands. The first will open all lockers. The second will close every second locker. The third will change the status of every third locker. If it is open, it will close; if closed it will open. The fourth will change every fourth locker." Purr purr purr. "It will continue in such a way for 100 steps." 



Sam couldn't listen. His stomach rebelled and he dry-heaved. Sweat streamed from him, mixing with tears he hadn't realized he was shedding. He watched his loved ones as they reacted to this place; this almost-personal Hell. They couldn't be here. Please let them not be here. 



Lisa and Ben, who looked so much like Dean, held one another in fear. Castiel had wiped their memory of the supernatural. They did not understand anything they saw here. Little more did Sarah, who had reached heaven at Crowley's hand and likely had been happy moments ago. 



The hunters weren't as lucky. Realization of where they had to be dawned on each face in turn
