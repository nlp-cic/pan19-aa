leaves first.

One day he isn't on his iPhone. He's has a notebook on his lap and a red pen. You swing for a little bit as he scribbles on it, taking glances at the paper each time you swing back. He's apparently doodling. You can't really make out the details.

You finally swing to a stop. You're fishing your phone from your pocket when he suddenly plops his notebook onto your lap.

"What are you doing?" you ask brusquely, looking at him. He just raises his eyebrows and taps at the notebook before handing you a black pen.

"What, can't reply?" you pester, not looking at the notebook. He frowns and taps at his headphones before nudging the notebook. You sigh and finally look.

There at the top in small red letters:

"who are you"

You stare at the statement and look at him. Is this guy serious? You scribble a reply below.

"EXCUSE MY FRENCH, BUT WHY THE UTTER FUCK WOULD THIS MATTER TO YOU?"

You return the notebook. He reads over your reply, writes his own reply, and gives it back to you.

"i dunnojust see you every day coming here after me and sitting down next to methought that we could at least talk if youre so keen on bursting my bubble"

"I'M NOT 'BURSTING YOUR BUBBLE' YOU PRICK. I'M JUST ENJOYING MYSELF AND MINDING MY OWN DAMN BUSINESS AT THIS PARK.
AND YOU CONSIDER THIS TALKING?"

"fuck yeah i doand youre enjoying yourself by lookin all over me huh"

"I WAS NOT!"

"yeah you were admit it"

"I WAS NOT AND YOU'RE BEING A COMPLETE FOOL."

"nahi think you are"

"AT LEAST MY STUPIDITY LEVELS DON'T NEARLY ACCOUNT TO YOURS."

"you just admitted youre stupidby the way why do you write in all capsdo you have a yelly problem"

"WHY DO YOU WRITE IN ALL LOWER CASE? YOU DON'T EVEN USE PUNCTUATION."

"better than all caps"

"FUCK YOU"

"haha"

He adds a doodle after this little comment. You stare at the strange figure. It has a strange mouth and a huge ass and you doubt that this thing can even be related to a human.

"WHAT IS THIS?"

"meet hella jeffchillest guy all around"

"HE LOOKS STUPID"

He added another doodle of another guy, underneath captioned:

"and this is sweet brotogether they make the raddest pairsweet bro & hella jeff see"

"ARE THESE TWO YOUR OWN CREATIONS?"

"of course how else can they get this quality"

"THEY'RE GROSS"

"youre not going to say that in a couple decades when you see them up on billboards"

"WHAT, SO THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN MOVIES?"

"of course duh"

This guy's insane. Only way to really explain it.

"YOU'RE INSANE."

"and youre...............who are you again?"

"I NEVER SAID. WHAT ARE YOU, AUTISTIC?"

"no but you can really help me if you just tell me your namehere ill tell you minemake it even yknownames dave strider"

You hold the notebook for a while, contemplating. He watches you the whole time, his foot tapping to whatever beat coming from his headphones.

You finally scribble down your reply.

"KARKAT VANTAS."

"sweetmind if i call you karklesor what about vantass"

"FUCK YOU."

"hahaha"

He didn't smile as he wrote this and doesn't smile as you read it. You can't even imagine the laugh even though you're reading it.

"YOU'RE HORRIBLE."

"and you too
anyway dude its time for me to head back
gonna be here tomorrow?"

"WHY WOULD YOU CARE?"

"wondering if its worth it for me to bring this notebook tomorrow duh"

Â It takes a second or two for the implication of this statement to hit you. He brought this notebook to talk to you...?

For a second you're almost flattered, but then you wonder why he just didn't TAKE OFF HIS HEADPHONES AND TALK TO YOU?

You write that down and shove him the notebook.

"well shit dude i can't stop listening to these mad beats"

"THAT'S A LIE."

"not kiddingwho knows maybe ill even let you listen to them yourselfanyway answer the damn question"

You sigh.

"YEAH, I HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO ANYWAY."

"sweet, see you tomorrow then"

"BYE, ASSHOLE"

He waves at you before walking away. You stare at his retreating figure, not really too sure what that was all about.

Sorry for taking so long with this. I'm mainly being lazy because I don't want to go through the trouble of color-coding them if anything, so it's my fault. Haha ;; Well enjoy this chapter! Two more to go!

I'm actually thinking of making the ending of this fanfiction a bit.. different from the version I posted on tumblr. Perhaps add a new character or two and add more
