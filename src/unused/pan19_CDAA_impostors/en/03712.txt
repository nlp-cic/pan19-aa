'Code-Red' to me when I asked so me and Martin went outside and played in G-Erti. Martin's little sister had come as well and we took turns being the captain and doing a cabin address while the others pretended to be the only two passengers on the flight. I wore my hat, even when I was a passenger. It nearly flew off in the wind but Martin's sister caught it. Martin's sister is very pretty and she's called Libby. When we went back inside all the adults were laughing and Mum was sitting next to Douglas. She looked very happy. I gave her a hug before I went to bed and told her I love her. I do love Mum, very much.

Lots of love, Arthur.

Dear Diary,

Mum said we can go to Russia in the summer holidays! She said we can't go at Christmas because it'll be winter and there'll be too much snow and wind. She said that when her and Dad are divorced and she has G-Erti she's going to set up a charter air company. I don't know what that is but it involves G-Erti and she said that Douglas will be one of our pilots and I can be an air-steward when I'm older. So I can be with Mum and Douglas and maybe even do the cabin address sometimes! Actually, she said Douglas will be the pilot is he promises not to do any smugglingbecause that will make her get in trouble too. And that she won't use Code Red very often with me unless it's very urgent. Mum says that she won't go on very many flights until I am older and can go with her. She says she doesn't want to leave me at home by myself and I don't want to stay with Dad for long times. She said Martin can maybe come on holiday with us, if it's okay with his parents. She's going to call the company MJN Air. She said the MJN stands for 'My Jet Now'. I think she's going to call it that to annoy Dad. I still have to wear my glasses at school but the boys have stopped pushing me over. And Martin has stopped bringing in ham sandwiches. He says he's sick of ham sandwiches and is going to keep buying food from town and sneaking out at lunch times. Douglas keeps coming over for dinner and I think he's going to be Mum's new 'significant other'. She seems happy when he's here. I looked charter air companies up on the internet, they sound fun. Sometimes there is only one or two passengers so the cabin crew just get to talk and watch all the clouds fly past. I'm looking forwards to being an air steward now. There's still boxes all over the house with 'Gordon' written on them. It doesn't feel like home with all Dad's boxes lying around. But Mum said he's going to pick them up soon.

Lots of love, Arthur.







Dear Diary,

I like going to school now. The mean boys have been put in a different class and I only see them at lunchtime and Martin looks after me then. I still have to wear my glasses but no one breaks them any more. I had a lovely dream where I was sitting on top of G-Erti when me and Mum and Douglas and Martin were flying over Russia and the wind was really strong but it didn't blow off my hat, Martin said the extra gold braid made it a magic hat that I could never lose. There were polar bears dancing on the clouds and there was music playing. Douglas was the pilot and I was the air steward and Mum and Martin were the two passengers. And Mum never used Code Red because she never wanted me to go away. Douglas kept calling Mum 'Carolyn' and kissing her cheek. She was happy. The sky was bright and purple when the sun set. Mum let me do thecabin address and I got to sing to Mum and Martin. It was a nice dream. All of Dad's boxes are gone now and Mum said that her and Dad are going to court tomorrow and after that they will be properly divorced and she will know if she gets to keep G-Erti. I hope she does get to keep G-Erti. I like the idea of having a charter airline where me and Mum can go all over the world for free. Mum is happier now that Dad has moved out. She told me that I have been talking about Martin a lot and was there something I wanted to tell her. I said I didn't know what she meant. She didn't say anything after that. I'm confused now.

Lots of love, Arthur.

 

Dear Diary,

I visited Dad today. I don't like his new house, it's really empty and all the walls are white. All of Dad's stuff is still in boxes with '
