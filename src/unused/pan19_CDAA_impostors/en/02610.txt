font I'd originally intended to use for the cover title, I used here.
The font is called Fresh Marker and I know it reads very close to how handwritten print marker looks.

I added different hand done 'rules' or underlines in various colors.  I chose the colors based on comic book
colors including a nude color that would be used for flesh.

Scene Separators are tricky in any story.  They can either enhance or detract.  I like to make scene separators that while they separate do not detract but support the story as it's unfolding.

For this story I wanted to try to hit a balance between seps that would reflect both Dean and Castiel as well as them as a couple.

The cartoon-ish bursts are a direct nod to Castiel's profession as a comic book artist.  They were fun to make!

This Dean image was taken from a screen capture from Season six.  I manipulated the coloring and saturation levels on the photo and then cropped it to reveal the focus I wanted.

To create the markers used in the scene sep, I started with one.  After isolating the pen, I also isolated the two tips and the two squiggles of ink.  These seps allowed me to change the tips and squiggles to other colors to reflect some of the most used colors in comic book illustrations.

I chose pancakes as the separator for the first part of chapter 3 to enhance the breakfast our guys share.  To create the sep I was lucky to find a great illustration of a stack of pancakes.





I added the type in one of four fonts that were particularly gathered for this story.  This type was manipulated in a soft curve to mimic the roundness of the stack.





After running the pancake stack through a couple of filters to make it look more 'drawn' I applied the type.

This is one of the simplest images in the story.  It was the image that was inspired the description of the room in the fic.

The image of Lucifer in the bar where Castiel's sister has her first party to kick off her wedding celebration was a scene both Cassie and I wanted to depict.

The first step, finding the right image or head shot of Mark Pellegrino.  I thought it would be pretty easy, but it was more difficult than I thought.  Mostly, because many of his canon shots are with deteriorated skin.  I combed through his personal shots to find what I needed. But, the body that I needed didn't necessarily come with the right head shot.  

The head shot I wanted was something where he looked a bit smarmy, smug.  Luckily, I found what I wanted.

Now, I needed a body double.  The one I used is of Daniel Craig and his hands were in a near perfect position to also hold a glass!

The bar where Lucifer is located is a piece of a larger photo of the bar that was described in the story.

Here are the thumbnails of the different images used to make the composite image of Lucifer in the bar.

Castiel's drawing of Dean with a gun that he creates while Dean is sleeping started with this image taken from Season Eight.





Before running this image through several different filters, I needed to repair Dean's ear.  There's a green ooze that can be seen coming from Dean's right ear.  Once that was repaired, I isolated him from the background and isolated the gun so that it could be enhanced.  

I ran both sets of images, the background and the figure of Dean, through a number of filters.  Then I made a composite of the various images at varying levels of opacity to create the final image.  I had to add in the smoke from the muzzle of the gun separately.

Once I had my final composite, I added it to a drawing pad, gently removed some of the perimeter of the final image.  Finally, I shadowed the edges of the pad and the image was completed.











Castiel's drawing of Dean that appears on the cover of the story was used here as well.  It started with another image from Jensen's photo shoot for China's Harper's Bazaar.  





Again, the original image was run through several filters and then layered in various opacities to create the final image.  After layering that image onto the drawing pad image, I took away parts of the perimeter to make it look more hand drawn.

There were several images that Cassie and I wanted to depict in this chapter.  

The first image was the Beach Party.  This
