upcoming battle.

He made his way to where he saw Dean stalk off too.

~~~~~~~~~~

Dean was in the bedroom when Cas found him, straightening.

"Dean, you're not being fair."

Dean heaved a sigh and smoothed his hand down the bed sheet, "I remember how boys act at that age, I was one of those boys! I'm not going to let Zepp get caught in that."

Cas walked up to Dean and wrapped his arms around his waist, lightly kissing his neck, "You need to let Zepp live her own life, make her own mistakes so she can learn. It's a part of life Dean."

Dean sighed and slumped, "Fine. But I'm taking them and there will be no kissing!"

Zeppelin squealed and Cas and Dean turned to see her peaking in the door. She ran up and hugged Dean, forcing Cas to let go.

"Thank you, thank you, thank you! Oh! I gotta go call him!" She gave Dean a big kiss on his cheek and ran from the room, pulling her phone out.

Dean sighed and ran a hand through his hair. Cas wrapped his arms around his neck, causing Dean to drop his hands to his waist. 

Cas gave him a deep kiss, "You did the right thing to make your daughter happy."

Dean smiled and leaned down to kiss Cas again.

They went dress shopping the next day. Cas was helping Zeppelin pick something out since he was more... In touch with that kind of thing, Dean was just following, holding dresses Zepp wanted to try.

They got a changing stall and Cas went with Zepp to help her with the dresses, Dean sat on the benches outside.

After many showings of dresses Zepp found a beautiful blue dress that brought her eyes out. Dean thought her daughter looked beautiful, no guy could deserve her.

Dean looked at the price and almost had a heart attack.

"What do you think I am? Made out of money?" Dean stared incredulously at Cas and Zepp, who tried to look innocent.

"Please daddy!" Zeppelin bought out the puppy eyes and tone that she only used when she wanted to get something. It worked 99% of the time.

Dean caved, "Fine." Zeppelin clapped her hands excitedly and took the dress from Cas, walking to checkout. Cas walked next to Dean, intertwining their hands.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The day of Prom Zeppelin was rushing around, getting ready.

"Papa, will you help me get my dress on?" Cas nodded and proceeded to help her.

Dean and Sam was outside of the door, waiting for her to be ready. Her date was supposed to be here soon.

The doorbell rang and Sam and Dean looked at each other and nodded, a silent agreement. They started walking toward the door but not before Cas himself poofed in front of them.

"You are not to be mean Sam and Dean Winchester. Its her first time bringing a boy home."

Dean scoffed and checked to see if his gun was visible so the kid would see it, "We'll be nice. Open the door."

Cas stared between the brothers suspiciously but turned and opened the door, "Hi, you must be Mark. Come in, Zeppelin's just finishing getting ready."

Cas shooed Sam and Dean from the doorway and let the kid in. 

"I am just going to go get her." Cas gave the brothers a hard stare and walked away to go check on Zeppelin.

Dean and Sam both stood to their full height and folded their arms.

Mark nervously scratched his neck, "Hello Mr. Winchester's, it's nice to finally meet you. Zeppelin had told me a lot about you guy's."

Dean nodded, "Uh-huh. Look Mark, I told my husband I was going to be nice but," Dean leaned closer to Mark, "I know how to hide a body and so does her uncle Sammy so if you dare hurt her, well you can take a guess at what will happen."

Mark had paled when Dean was talking and he looked to Sam, averting his eyes when he saw Sam was just as serious.

Mark nodded, "I promise I won't dare hurt her."

"And here is Zeppelin!"

Dean straightened and turned to see his daughter was walking in and she was beautiful. Her hair was curled and she had just the right amount of makeup on to make her stand out. She was gorgeous.

Mark sucked in a breath, whispering, "Wow."

Dean smiled at his daughter and walked over and gave her a hug, 'You look beautiful Zepp."

Zeppelin groaned, "Daddddyyyy."

Dean chuckled and let her go. Zeppelin walked over to Mark, smiling at him. She looked to Dean, "Can we go?"

Dean grabbed his keys and kissed Cas's cheek, going out to the impala, Zeppelin and Mark following.

When Dean got home Cas was reading a book and Sam was somewhere else. Dean sat next to him, laying his hand on Cas's thigh.

Cas put his book
