some kind of music or had the tv on, he was use to his room being so loud. However with it smelling of weed, being dark and quiet, it just made him feel strange. 


 


“Jer,” Michael spoke softly. He looked over to his friend, he still had his eyes closed and his red hood was kept over his head. He was curled up in the bean bag but he looked extremely uncomfortable. 


 


“Yeah bud?” Jeremy replied, he kept his voice at nearly a whisper. He didn’t wanna speak too loud and ending up making his best friend’s headache worse. 


 


“How did you know you had a crush on Christine?” 


 


Jeremy was took off guard by the question he rubbed the back of his neck and looked away. “Uh, I guess when I started getting flustered when I was around her. Or when I started to thinking of kiss her, and well..other things,” Jeremy replied. He shifted a little in the bean bag, not completely sure if that was the answer Michael was looking for. 


 


“Can you like someone romantically, even if you don’t have sexual desires to them?” Michael asked. 


 


“Y-Yeah of course!” Jeremy quickly said but soon felt bad as he raised his voice a little. “I m-mean there are people out there who are more attracted by someone’s personality over looks, and some people just don’t get sexual desires to other people,” he finished. 


 


Michael was silent again, he sat up and opened his eyes. They were still red but not as bad, he rubbed his eyes before shifting his bean bag closer to Jeremy’s. The bean bags practically touched and Michael layed back down on his but rested his head on Jeremy’s lap. The pale boy’s eyes widen slightly but he did nothing to get Michael off. Instead he let him stay how he was and simply ran his fingers through Michael’s black and semi curly locks. 



The two didn’t say anything to one another, they remained quiet which resulted into Michael falling asleep. Once he did, Jeremy shifted a little and grabbed his phone out of his back pocket and texted Christine. 


 


Jeremy!Heere!: 
I checked up on Michael


 


Play4Life: 
How is he?! 


 


Jeremy!Heere!: 
High, like really high. He’s currently passed out on my lap though. He won’t tell me what’s bothering him 


 


Play4Life: 
Oh wow. He didn’t like...harm himself...did he? 


 

 


Jeremy glanced at the text for a moment or two before looking at Michael, he didn’t wanna make assumptions. He wanted to be 100% sure that Michael did NOT hurt himself. So carefully, and very slowly, he lifted up Michael’s sleeve on his hood. When Michael did self harm, it was always on his arm, so he knew if he were to start up again it would most likely be in the same spot. He sighed in relief to see no wounds however frowned a little when he saw old scars. He gently rolled the sleeve back down and brought his attention back to his phone. 


 

 


Jeremy!Heere!: 
no scars, just checked….I really wish he’d tell me what’s wrong though. 


 


Jeremy!Heere!: 
It’s just not like him to be so secretive...ever since everyone became unsquipped he’s been acting strange….


 


Jeremy!Heere!: 
Oh god! What if he ended up liking me better with my squip?! WHAT IF HE GOT A SQUIP OF HIS OWN!!!!


 


Play4Life: 
Jeremy please calm down. Michael adored you before the squip and he still does. Plus he showed a lot of hate to the squip so I doubt he got one of his own, plus he’s always drinking mountain dew red. So it wouldn’t even work if he did have one? 


 


Jeremy!Heere!: 
True…..but...god Christine I don’t know what’s wrong! This is so just so unlike him. He avoided going to school for five days, he avoided 

us

 for five days! 


 


Play4Life: 
Yes that is unlike him….look, you said he’s asleep on your lap correct? When he wakes up he might be more...aware of everything and maybe then you can talk to him about everything. 


 


Jeremy!Heere!: 
Okay...yeah..I’ll ask him when he wakes up. I’ll text you after all of it. Bye.


 


Play4Life
: Bye bye! Good luck as well! 


 

 


Jeremy sighed softly and set his phone down. He looked back down at Michael and gently went back to running his hand through his thick hair. He frowned softly as thoughts began to fill his mind. What if Michael did get a squip and he hasn’t been drinking mountain dew red? What if he is self harming somewhere else? He shook his head and tried to think of something else, anything else, however it was nearly impossible. He couldn’t shake the fact off that Michael was hiding something from him. They’ve been friends for so long that Jeremy never
