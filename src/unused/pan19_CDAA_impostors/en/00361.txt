,” He crooned, reaching into the crib to pick her up, “I’m here, don’t worry.” Nick cradled her in both of his arms, trying to calm Isabelle down, but she kept crying, low, insistent yowls that grated on Nick’s ears.	“What’s wrong sweetie?” He asked the still crying kit, “Are you hungry?” Nick carried her to the kitchen and opened the fridge with one arm, holding Isabelle in the other while he rummaged for her bottle. He pulled it out of the fridge and held it up to her snout. Isabelle took it and began drinking, causing a wave of relief to sweep through Nick, only for that relief to die when she spit it out seconds later and resume crying.	“It’s ok.” He murmured, putting the bottle down and patting her back, “I guess it’s something else then huh?” Isabelle gave him no answer, instead continuing her snuffling and yowling. 	“Do you need to be changed?” He asked her gently, sniffing the air for any trace of such a problem. 	“It’s not that.” He said softly, frowning as he tried to figure out what else it could be, “Why’re you so upset sweetie?” He asked, worry creasing his brow. Nick carried her back to the nursery and sat in a chair in the corner, still holding her in his arms. He tried playing with her to distract her, but Isabelle wouldn’t stop crying. Nick tried singing a lullaby, caressing her ears, even pedaling her hind paws! But nothing worked. Isabelle just kept crying. Nick’s panic began to grow as each little yowl hurt him.	“I don’t know why you’re unhappy!” He said hysterically, raising his voice, “Please just stop crying!” Nick buried his head in his paws and rubbed his tired eyes, still listening to the poor kit’s pitiful cries. Nick pulled out his phone and checked the time. 3 AM. Isa had been crying non-stop for an hour! He unlocked his phone and held it in his paw, thinking about his next move.	“Sorry Judy.” He whispered, pressing call, “But I need your help.” Nick put the phone to his ear and waited as it rang.	“Nick, it’s 3 AM what’s going on?” Judy answered groggily.	“I need your help.” He said somewhat frantically, “Isa’s been crying for the past hour and I’ve tried everything and I don’t know what else to do and I’m tired and—”	“I’ll be right over.” Judy interrupted, “Just give me a few minutes.” 	“Thank you so much Judy!” Nick responded, “I’ll see you soon.” Nick hung up and put his phone back in his pocket. He continued cradling Isa in his arms and she continued crying. ______________________________________________________________________________	Judy let herself in using the key Nick had given her. She walked into the nursery to find a teary-eyed Nick holding a clearly distressed Isabelle. 	“Hey Nick.” She said softly, causing him to look up, “Has anything changed?”	“No.” He replied, “She’s still crying. I tried feeding her, changing her, playing with her, singing a lullaby, trying to get her back to sleep, and she’s still crying.” Judy eyed the exhausted fox with concern.	“May I?” She asked, holding out her arms for the kit. Nick got up and gently handed her Isabelle. 	“There there,” She murmured, “it’s ok.” Isabelle, who had calmed down slightly earlier, now began crying with renewed energy. 	“It’s alright,” Judy said softly, giving her back to Nick, “your daddy’s right here.” Once Nick took hold of her, Isabelle calmed down slightly, but still continued to cry. Judy watched the upset kit critically while she tried to diagnose what was wrong with her.	“Is this her blanket?” She asked Nick, gesturing at the one lying in the crib. Nick nodded and Judy picked it up and left the room. Nick followed her out and watched in confusion as she put it in a glass bowl and placed it in his microwave. Judy set the timer to 30 seconds and then turned it on, waiting for the blanket to warm up. Nick gave her a quizzical look and Judy shrugged, which Nick took as a sign that she’d explain it in a minute. Judy took the now hot blanket out of the microwave and motioned for Nick to give her Isabelle. Nick lowered his kit into Judy’s arms and Judy quickly wrapped Isabelle in the warm blanket. Almost immediately, her cries turned to snuffles, which then stopped completely. After a minute of tense silence, Nick stared in wonderment at the now soundly sleeping fox kit in Judy’s arms. Judy walked into the nursey with Nick trailing closely behind her and gently lowered Isabelle into the crib. Nick watched and made sure that she remained asleep, then
