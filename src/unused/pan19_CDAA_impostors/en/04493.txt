of a deal that has become very complicated."

"I can see that." Graham glanced in the direction of the envelope.

Emma picked it up and slowly opened it.






You've bewitched me, Emma.







I can't stop thinking about you.







I'll pick you up at 7:30 on Saturday evening.







Surprise me.




"He's coming here?" Mary Margaret was appalled to think that Gold would be knocking on her door within minutes. The man always made her a bit nervous.

"Don't worry. We're not staying. He'll only be here for a minute." Emma attempted to calm her roommate. It's not as if Mary Margaret wasn't used to seeing Gold; the man came by every month like clockwork to collect the rent. Maybe it was the prospect of having to have a social exchange with him that had her unnerved.

No sooner did Emma get the words out of her mouth than they heard him knock. Emma gathered her purse and headed to the door. She had every intention of whisking Gold out of there before he could even notice Mary Margaret.

"Good evening, Emma. " His eyes seemed to caress her body even as he held her gaze in his.

"Hi, Gold. I'm all set. No need for us to hang around here."

To Emma's annoyance, Gold moved past her and further into the apartment, evidently in no rush to leave.

"Slow down, Emma. First, let me say that you look ravishing tonight." Emma blushed as Gold took her hand and kissed it, all the while staring intently into her eyes. She could feel Mary Margaret observing them, sure that she was carefully assessing their every move and look.

He then turned to Mary Margaret. "Good evening, Miss Blanchard. I trust you are doing well?"

"Hello, Mr. Gold. Yes, very well. Thanks. And you?"

"Quite well, my dear. After all, I'll be spending my evening in the company of your lovely roommate."

Mary Margaret smiled. "I hope you two enjoy your evening."

"I have no doubt that I will. I can only hope that Emma will enjoy it half as much."

"I'll see you later." Emma interrupted. She linked her arm with Gold's and proceeded to lead him out.

"Have fun!" Mary Margaret got out the last word and smiled contentedly to herself. He was smitten with Emma, she had no doubt. And Emma, no matter how much she wanted to deny it, was just as smitten.

Emma's little surprise for Gold was the fact that she was wearing a form-fitting red dress with no underwear. She couldn't help thinking about how he'd react to this as they made their way to his car. By the time they got there, Emma was aroused and wet and not interested in anything but how Gold's slightest touch made her body react.

"Gold, let's get in the back seat."

"Ah! Is this my surprise?" Gold gave her a look filled with appreciation and undisguised lust.

"I guess you can say that it's part of it. The truth is that I just want you and I can't wait."

Gold smiled knowingly. "Far be it from me to leave a lady waiting. Your wish is my command, my dear."

They slid into the back seat and sat side by side. Gold put his left arm around her and drew her into a slow lingering kiss. Emma threaded both of her hands in his hair and kissed him back passionately in return. Sensing her urgency, Gold slid his hand under her dress and up her thighs. When he reached her center he realized that she had no clothing on under her dress.

"Emma." Gold's voice betrayed his surprise and desire for her. "Lie back and put your legs over my lap." Emma did as he requested. She obviously needed attention and Gold was going to give it to her. He took the hem of her dress in his hands and pulled it up exposing her to him. Emma could feel his arousal pressing against her and she was desperate for him to touch her. "Gold, please."

Gold didn't need an invitation. He slipped two fingers into her and lightly stroked her clit with his thumb. Emma arched her back and moaned in response. "You're so wet, darling. Let's take the edge off a bit. Come for me. I love seeing you come, Emma." She opened her legs for him in response and he felt himself harden even more than he thought possible. He began to slowly thrust both fingers into her while he used the palm of his other hand to stroke her center. He made sure to caress her clit at each pass and she arched her back and gasped every time he touched her most sensitive area.

He loved touching her and feeling her writhe under him and he expertly teased her until she couldn't stand it anymore. She
