the front line, Daichi got his orders taken, the one in the back, who was simply admiring the café's decorations and interiors, looked up, his dark blue eyes widens, a blush appeared on his face,

'Cute...,' He thought to himself as his eyes landed to the guy on the cashier, the way his orange hair shifts a little as he moves, his blue eyes which looks so soothing,  not to mention that adorable smile which makes him more adorable than ever, not noticing, Tsukishima, who happens to be in front of him, has left,

Hinata gave Asahi the order, and turned back to the cashier to serve the next costumer,

"Hello!,may i take your order-" Hinata said, smiling a little, then stopped, his brown eyes landed on the male in front of him who seems to have his eyes fixed to him,

'Goddamn he's hot,' Hinata blushed at the thought, then, the male in front of him snapped out of his daze,

"A-ah, sorry ,i-i'll just have milk tea," he said, Hinata nodded slightly, the blush on their faces seems to be seriously visible,



"Would you like it cold or hot?" Hinata asked,



"Cold," Kageyama answered sternly,



Hinata was slightly shocked in the inside, but takes it calmly like he usually would, not always though, as Hinata wrote his order, Kageyama finally noticed his right arm, tingling ever since he got his order taken,

'Could it be?'Kageyama thought to himself, lifting up his black sleeve, he found the word 

'Goddamn he's hot -Hinata Shoyou-' Kageyama blushed at the words on his arm, quickly pulling his sleeve down, he turns back to the male,



"That would be 200 yen," he said, Kageyama handed him the money, and received the receipt, saying his thanks badly, he quickly left to the others,

As he finally reaches them, sat down, and checked the receipt, checking his order, his eyes widened at the word,

 

'Cashier:Hinata Shoyou'

 

Hinata turns around, and said, "Nishinoya, can we switch?i need..a moment," Hinata said,



Nishinoya looked at him, confused, "eh?what happened?are you sick?are you going to faint?" Nishinoya asked, Hinata shook his head no, with no words, he shows Nishinoya his wrist, to find

 

'Cute...-Kageyama Tobio-'written on his right hand

 

Kageyama covered his face with his hands, he shoves the receipt back to his pocket,

"Oya oya?is Kageyama flustered?" Bokuto teased,



"Oya oya oya?"Kuroo added, snickering at the youngest male's flustered position,



"Oi,stop it,"Daichi said, instantly shutting the two up, the blonde beside him snickered,

"The Kageyama Tobio is flustered? is it going to hail tomorrow?" Tsukishima teased, Daichi sighed at their behaviour, and asked,



"Now now,what's wrong Kageyama?" Daichi asked, with not a single word nor letter leaving his mouth, he shows them his receipt, lifting his sleeve up and showed it to the others,all of them leaned in,

"Whaaat?" Bokuto said, his owl-like eyes widens, though his mouth was in an obvious grin,



"Kageyama's soulmate's the cashier guy?how cute," Kuroo said,



Daichi smiled, and patted Kageyama's shoulder, "congratulations,Kageyama," Daichi said,

"Here are your orders," a voice said, three men stood there, one with brown hair, one with brown-greenish hair, and the last one has gray hair, as they served their food, Daichi can't help but stare at the one with the gray hair,

'He's..,cute,' Daichi thought to himself, blushing, the one Daichi secretly-admires-from-afar noticed Kageyama's hand, showing the words which belongs to his soulmate's first thought,



"Ah,Hinata?"he asked,

"What?"Bokuto asked,



"Ah,Hinata has a soulmate~" the one with brown hair said, as the last one stood silent,



"Hinata's the one who works at the cashier, and not to mention, we've never seen any of you in here before, first comer?" he asked,



Daichi nodded, "we are, since there are a lot of people coming here, we thought we might give it a try," Daichi says,

'Damn,he's attractive,'Suga thought,trying his best to not turn red,

As the two talk, Oikawa can't help it but steal glances at the one with a spiked dark brown haired male with those alluring dark eyes,

'Holy shit,he's hot,'Oikawa thought, not noticing, the one who Oikawa was staring at, Iwaizumi, notices him, his face immediately turned slightly red,

'What a dork..,'Iwaizumi thought, 

"I would love to talk to all of you, i really do, but we still have a lot of people to
