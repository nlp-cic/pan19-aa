back of my neck start burning and the long scratch in my thigh start screaming. They’re screaming to be touched, to be kissed. 

 “Hey guys,” Liam smiled, shaking everyone’s hand. I stood up to give him a proper hello. A hug which we have always shared. 

 Liam took a step back. His hand outstretched. 

 “Lili,” but the voice isn’t my own. A tall, curly haired freak came running onstage. She waved frantically to the rest of us but wrapped her arms around Liam’s waist. 

 Liam leaned down to stare into her eyes. He leaned down. Kissing her. 

 The same lips that were kissing me last night. “What’s wrong, beautiful?”

 Danielle pouted her lips when they separated. “You forgot to say goodbye.”

 No. Fucking. Kidding. 

 *   *   *   *   * 

Heat. Better yet. Fury. 

 When Danielle left, I stormed off the stage, pass Paul and outside to my car. Who the fuck did Liam think he was? To use me? Again, for fucksake? 

 I slammed the car door behind me. Automatically bursting out into frantic tears. 

 “You are so fucking dumb, Zayn,” I said to myself. “You are a fucking loser that deserves to die. You are so fucking worthless. You ---.”

 The car door swung open. Hands pulled me out of the driver’s seat and pinned me against the hard surface. “What the fuck are you doing?” Liam asked. His caramel eyes were hard. Vengeful. “Do you fucking think you’re making things look any better when you fucking cry every time you see her?” 

 I mumbled, incoherently. 

 “Zayn, you fucking bastard! The guys are already asking what’s wrong with you. You only make it obvious that you love me.”

 “I do love you, you fucking idiot!”

 “SHUT THE FUCK UP!” he bellowed. “NOT HERE! NOT NOW!”

 “I FUCKING LOVE YOU LIAM PAYNE! I FUCKING LOVE YOU MORE THAN THE STARS IN THE SKY! I FUCKING LOVE YOU MORE THAN MUSIC. MORE THAN MY FUCKING RELIGION! I LOVE YOU, LIAM PAYNE! FOREVER!”

 I shoved Liam away, the hardest I could. He faltered a bit. I used that time to jump back into the car. Locking it behind me. Liam pounded against the glass and I could hear it cracking. I started the car, leaving a running Liam behind me.  

*   *   *   *   * 

Emptiness. 

*   *   *   *   * 

Darkness.

 *   *   *   *   *

 Screaming. 

 Liam is screaming on the other side of the door. I can hear the cracks in his voice. In his heart? Or is it just my hearing? What kind of heart does Liam have if he just soaks all my love for himself, leaving me with nothing but emptiness? His heart isn’t a heart. 

 It’s a vacuum. 

 Soaking up what used to be the endless pool of love I had for him. Slowly, it’s becoming barren. But my eyes have yet to find such luck. As Liam is pounding on the door, yelling for me to open it, “Fuck Zayn, just open the door. I’m---I’m so---you know what. FUCK YOU! I fucking hate you, Zayn.”

 That makes the two of us.  

*  *   *   *   *

 Absence. 

 They say absence makes the heart grow fonder. 

 It does. 

 But I’m not sure if it’s a two way street. 

 Of course I miss Liam. And the boys. It’s been a week since I left the house. Ignoring the endless calls for rehearsal, for press interviews. Paul has stopped by the house a total of ten times. My mother twenty times. The guys, totaled thirty. 

 Liam, none. 

 Ever since I ignored him that night. 

 He deserved it . . . or did I?

 I deserve being used by my best friend? To feed his sexual appetite and be left starving for more? Attention maybe? Love? 

 Definitely. 

 Maybe I deserved to feel this way? Weak. Breakable. 

 Ugly. 

 Sure, my outside was beautiful, but maybe that’s where my luck ended. There was nothing wholesome or desirable inside . . . My heart was already dust. My blood was tainted with the need for someone who I know doesn’t deserve me. 

 But is it me? It has to be! 

 What’s so special about me? 

 That I’m a superstar? 

 So are a ton of others.

 Because I’m beautiful? 

 Says who? 

 I sighed at my reflection in the bathroom mirror. 

 I’m thankful to have all my tattoos. All the indications that I need to mask myself with drawings so people detour away from the true art inside of me. 

 The art of being unwanted. Just a toy shoved in the back of the shelf that no one touches or buys. Soon I’ll be washed up. Without family. Without friends. Without fans. Being stripped from everything, I’ll be left
