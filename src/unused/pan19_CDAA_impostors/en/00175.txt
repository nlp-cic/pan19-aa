as he spoke. Something that seemed nearly unthinkable for someone with such a projecting voice. "Will you...say hello to him for me?"Â 

Mettaton couldn't help but feel touched. He had a lot of fans but...This skeleton talked about him in a different way, as if recalling a memory of an old friend. How peculiar.

"What's your name, Darling?" the robot asked.

"OH, I AM THE GREAT PAPYRUS, AND THIS IS MY LAZY BROTHER, SANS!" The tall one introduced them quickly, snapping out of his momentarily timid demeanor. "I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING SO LATE WITH MY INTRODUCTIONS! HOW RUDE OF ME!"

So THIS was Papyrus. Not what Mettaton was expecting, but it certainly made sense now that he'd said it.

"Hey bro, I hate to interrupt, but here comes the human." Sans pointed out, shoving his hands into his pockets.

"Oh my. Leave it to me!" the robot piped up, wheeling himself into place, and connecting to the puzzle hurriedly. He'd been so intrigued by his conversation with Papyrus, that he'd nearly forgotten why he was there in the first place. He retracted his arms and wheel, so his appearance was nothing more than a rectangular machine.

Papyrus glanced over curiously, while closer the human approached.

"Now Darling, when you're ready, just tell me, but do be discreet about it." The robot instructed quietly.

"OF COURSE, HAPPSTATON." Papyrus nodded in understanding. He was even more fun to watch in person, as opposed to the big screen in the laboratory. The rules were fairly standard, and despite the fact Mettaton knew the rules quite well, he enjoyed listening to Papyrus explain them. Something about the skeleton's voice resonated with him.

"NOW THEN!" The skeleton raised his right hand, an indication that he was about to begin.

"RED TILES ARE IMPASSIBLE: YOU CANNOT WALK ON THEM! YELLOW TILES ARE ELECTRIC! THEY WILL ELECTROCUTE YOU! GREEN TILES ARE ALARM TILES! IF YOU STEP ON THEM... YOU WILL HAVE TO FIGHT A MONSTER!!" Papyrus smirked as he said this, as if he knew something. The underground was filled to the brim with monsters, and as Mettaton had observed earlier on the laboratory screen- the human had already "fought" their fair share of monsters. Of course, in his opinion: this human seemed like a pacifist. Instead of fighting; they used clever tactics to calm the monsters down until they no longer wished to fight. Clever. Very clever.

"ORANGE-TILES ARE ORANGE-SCENTED. THEY WILL MAKE YOU SMELL DELICIOUS! BLUE TILES ARE WATER TILES. SWIM THROUGH THEM IF YOU WILL, BUT... IF YOU SMELL LIKE ORANGES, THE PIRANHAS WILL BITE YOU."

As the explanation continued, Mettaton couldn't help but wonder why on earth, or HOW on earth Alphys had managed to place piranhas in the tile puzzle. Some sort of magic most likely. In the Underground, it was best not to think too hard about these sorts of things. As long as it was entertaining, that's all he cared about.

"ALSO, IF A BLUE TILE IS NEXT TO A YELLOW TILE, THE WATER WILL ALSO ZAP YOU! PURPLE TILES ARE SLIPPERY! YOU WILL SLIDE TO THE NEXT TILE! HOWEVER; THE SLIPPERY SOAP... SMELLS LIKE LEMONS!! WHICH PIRAHNAS DO NOT LIKE! PURPLE AND BLUE ARE OKAY!" Papyrus took a deep breath, seeming more and more exhilarated by the second.

"AND FINALLY, PINK TILES. THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING. STEP ON THEM ALL YOU LIKE." Papyrus grinned. "DOES THAT ALL MAKE SENSE?"

Mettaton couldn't see the human's reaction from where he was, but he did hear them speak a soft "Yes, got it."

"EXCELLENT!" Papyrus' eye sockets sparkled in delight, and he trotted excitedly over to Mettaton.

"HAPPSTATON, YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND ACTIVATE THE PUZZLE NOW." He spoke as softly as he could, placing a gloved hand on Mettaton's side. No sooner had he felt Papyrus' touch, did the robot feel a spark in his gears, and then- a vision! It lasted only a second, but the image was as clear as day all the same!

Papyrus was still standing in front of him, but instead of asking him to activate a puzzle, he was holding his hand, smiling at him with an adoring look on his face. Instead of Snowdin, he was in a warmly lit room, the two of them bathed in the reflection of the lights. Mettaton could feel his soul fluttering inside of his metal chasis, and just like that, the vision faded. Papyrus was still looking at Mettaton, but instead of a look of adoration, the skeleton's face was filled with confusion and concern.

"Th-that was strange..." The skeleton shook his head and turned back to the robot with his usual loud voice. "H-HAPPSTATON? ARE YOU ALRIGHT? DID YOU HEAR ME?"

If Mettaton could blush, he would have been blushing deeply. What
