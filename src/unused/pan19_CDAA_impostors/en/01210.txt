his lap and rest my head on his chest. After about 15 minutes, Maura informs us that dinner is ready. We sit down to steak, mashed potatoes, and roasted asparagus, and easily slip into conversation.
"So do you have any special plans while you guys are here?" Maura asks.
I look at Niall, who shakes his head.
"No. I was thinking of just relaxing here. Nothing special." he says.
I frown, but don't say anything. Has he forgotten our anniversary is in two days? We continue eating and when we're finished, Niall and I clear the table and then join Maura in the living room. We continue to talk and catch up until we all decide to head to bed. When we get up to Niall's room, he pulls me into a kiss. I return it, but then pull away.
"I'm actually really tired, Niall."
"Alright. Let's go to bed then." he says, looking a bit disappointed. I peel off my clothes and slip on one of Niall's shirts that I stole, and climb into bed. Niall strips down to his boxers and joins me.
"Good night, Princess." he says, pulling me to him.
"Night." I say, shutting my eyes. I sigh when I realize that he doesn't notice that I am upset.
Waking up the next morning, I slip out of bed, letting Niall sleep. I pull on a pair of Niall's sweats and walk downstairs to see Maura already awake.
"Morning darling. Would you like some coffee?" she asks.
"Yes, please. And good morning." I reply with a smile.
"Did you sleep well last night?" she asks, handing me my coffee.
"It wasn't too bad. You know, jet lag and all." We sit there in silence for a few minutes before I get an idea. "Maura. Do you think you could run me into town later? I need to pick up something for mine and Niall's anniversary tomorrow and I don't want him to see it."
"Of course, Kelly. Maybe we can go after lunch." she suggests.
"That would be perfect. Thank you so much."
"Of course. It's no problem."
A few minutes later, Niall comes down and joins us.
"Morning, Princess." he says, kissing my cheek.
"Morning, Ni."
The morning goes by pretty quick and it's finally time for Maura and I to go to town. I'm in Niall's room, changing, when he walks in.
"Going somewhere?" he asks, wrapping his arms around my waist from behind.
"Yeah. You mother and I are going into town for a while."
"Okay. You know, it makes me so happy that you get along so well with her."
"She's an amazing woman. And she's very easy to get along with."
"Well, let's not keep her waiting. Have fun."
"I will. I love you, Ni. You know that right?" I say, turning and hugging him tightly.
"Of course I do. And I love you. To the moon and back."
He kisses the top of my head and let's me go. I kiss him quickly and head downstairs. Maura and I spent a couple hours in town before we went into a little jewelry shop. I was browsing the bracelets they had, when I found one that was absolutely perfect. It was a brown leather band with the words "Made in Mullingar" burned into it.
"Excuse me. How much for this?" I asked the shopkeeper, pointing out the bracelet.
"Oh. That's €75."
"Is there a way to have a phrase put on the back of it?"
"Yes. We personalize for free."
"Okay. I will take it. How long does it take to personalize?"
"About an hour."
"Okay. I would like the phrase 'mo ghrá, mo prionsa' on it please."
"My love, my prince. Cute. Who's the lucky lad?"
"My boyfriend. It's our anniversary tomorrow."
"Well, congratulations. I will have this done in about an hour. You pay when you pick it up." she smiles.
"Thank you so much."
Maura and I leave to go grab a coffee.
"Maura?" I ask.
"Yes, darling?"
"Do you think that Niall will like my gift?"
"I think he will love it. It's a beautiful piece. And, no matter what, he loves you."
"To the moon and back." I whisper, smiling. "I'm just afraid he's forgotten our anniversary. He hasn't said anything to me at all." I sigh.
"I'm sure he hasn't forgotten. You're too special for him to forget something as big as that."
"
