month anniversary!"

 "I want to wait."

 "Until?"

 "Our one year anniversary."

 "That's in two months."

 "He can't know."

 "He won't." I assure. "Not from me anyway."

 "Offended!" Lou exclaims.

 "You say almost anything when you're drunk."

 "Right..."

 "I've only been drunk once, and I don't remember it."

 "I wish you did, love."

 "Stop that. Zayn is right here."

 "So?"

 "You're a hypocrite."

 "Fine."

 Zayn laughs. "You are so whipped."

 "When did you figure that?" Lou mutters.

 "When Clara told you to hit Ni."

 "He had that a long time coming."

 "How long?"

 "A few years."

 Zayn frowns. "What did he do?"

 "I know." I say.

 "Please do tell."

 "It was the time that Ni made out with Haz at the club."

 Lou nods. "How do you know?"

 "Haz told me when he came home."

 "Of course he did."

 "I kind of miss those times."

 "Why?"

 "Everything was so much easier."

 "How so?"

 "All I had to really worry about is you five and Jer."

 "And now?"

 "My siblings, Jed, Clarity, Josh, Clayton, Maria, even Gemma and Tony."

 "Is that all?"

 "I have to put up with a hormonal Liam for fuck's sake!"

 Zayn chuckles. "I'll deal with him."

 "You better." Lou sighs. "His mood swings almost as bad as Clara's."

 "Wow, Louis."

 "It's true."

 "Nice way to talk about your girlfriend!" Ni laughs through the phone.

 "You finally talk." I say. "Took you long enough."

 "It was hilarious listening to your conversations."

 "What part?"

 "The part when Zee said Lou is whipped."

 "And how he hit you?"

 "You hit harder than Lou, Cee."

 "And you would know!" Lou chuckles.

 "Multiple times." Zayn adds.

 I hit them both over the back of their heads.

 "Ouch!" Zayn yelps.

 "Clara!" Lou groans.

 "That's harsh, Cee." Haz sighs.

 "Wait!" Ni exclaims. "When are you coming to visit?"

 "Maybe this weekend." I say. "Depends on school."

 "Since when do you care about school?"

 "When I found out that I am at the top of the grade."

 "WHAT?!" Lou, Zayn, Haz and Ni yell.

 "Top of the grade?!" Liam yells. "Why didn't you say something?!"

 "I knew you'd react this way!" I shout.

 "Seriously, Cee?" Haz sighs. "That is what was stopping you?"

 "Yep."

 "You can be such a bitch."

 "I know."

 "I don't know what goes through their heads!" Haz exclaims.

 "We're all crazy, Haz." I say. "Just some more than others."

 "Deffinately."

 "And our group are only a hanful of those."

 "Also correct."

 "We've lost our level-headed guy."

 "How so?"

 "Li's begging for it, and Zee won't give for another two months."

 "Harsh. Who's in charge?"

 "Guess."

 "Clara? Of course. Lou isn't that level-headed."

 "Li never was. Clara has always been."

 "That's true, Ni."

 I lay back on our queen sized bed and smile slightly. Haz watches me with a smirk and then leaves our room. The fluffy pillow dips under the weight of my head and cushions it nicely. The bed then dips under Haz's weight and he lays behind me. He wraps his arm around my waist and pulls me against him. I snuggle against him and sigh.

 "Night, Ni." Haz murmurs.

 "Night, babe." I yawn.

 "Get some sleep."

 "You too."


__~__~__~__~__~


 I jerk awake and fall of the bed, landing on the floor with a thud. Haz mumbles sleepily and hugs my pillow tightly. I smile fondly at my sleeping boyfriend and carefully get up off the hard floor. I wander out onto the balcony and stare down at the reflection of the moon on the clear pool. For some reason, I feel like there is something missing right now.

Who's gonna be the first one to start the fight?Who's gonna be the first one to fall asleep at night?Who's gonna be the last one to drive away?Who's gonna be the last one to forget this place?
