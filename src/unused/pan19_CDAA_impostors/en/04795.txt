rolled his eyes.

"If anybody needs layers, it's you Steve. You don't produce much body heat and -"

"Shut up and take the damn clothes with your ungrateful ass."

----------------------------------------------------

3. Feed your teddy bear. Purchase fake food in order to help it maintain a well-balanced diet. Be sure that it receives enough nutrients in order to avoid starvation. Feed it an appropriate amount of food to avoid serious weight gain or loss. You could also share your dinner with it and pretend to feed it. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why the fuck would Steve buy fake food when Bucky and himself are human beings who are alive and need real food in order to survive? How would they even get nutrients from fake food? It's not possible. Whoever wrote this damn article, shouldn't have been allowed near a computer because obviously they're too damn stupid to realize THAT YOU CAN'T FUCKING GET THE NUTRIENTS YOUR BODY NEEDS FROM FAKE FOOD AND THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GAIN WEIGHT ANYWAY CAUSE IT'S FUCKING FAKE. DAMMIT. WHO THE FUCK-

---------------

4.  Bring your bear along on trips. Take pictures of your best moments together, and keep it in a photo album so you can later look through them. Make good memories with it, and have lots of fun together. However, make sure it always stays by your side so it you don't accidentally lose it. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bucky decided that he would always accompany Steve anywhere he goes because Steve is someone who can't just go to the fucking store and buy some damn cookies without getting into an argument with a stranger and being ready to throw down some hands. Bucky takes pictures of Steve all the time, but Steve is camera shy and doesn't like pictures so he always tries to block the cameras view of himself but Bucky's been able to get some pictures of Steve whenever he isn't ready or when he tries to block the camera. Steve calls him annoying but Bucky doesn't care. Steve's annoying too.

-------------------------------------------------------

5. Care for your teddy bear's health. When it falls ill, give it enough medicine for a healthy recovery. Feed it hot soup with plenty of nutrients to fight off the germs. Comfort it by wrapping a blanket around it and giving it cuddles. Watch television shows or read it books to pass the time. Be sure that it receives plenty of rest in bed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Steve, honestly, all I'm doing is coughing-"

"Yeah and coughing turns into hacking mucus out your throat and you getting irritated that you can't get it out then you get all grumpy when you keep drinking tea or coffee and it's not helping with the mucus in your throat so you-"

"I fucking get it. Geez."

"well then If you get it then take the damn Halls cough drops!"

"I DON'T WANT TOO!"

"DAMMIT BUCKY!"

"DAMMIT STE- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACK!!!"

---------------------------------------

6. Remember that you are your teddy bear's role model. It will copy your actions since it looks up to you. Set a good example for it by having good character and being honest. Teach it good manners so that it can have a healthy social life. Allow it to interact with your other stuffed animals so that it can make friends. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The only time when Bucky copies Steve's actions is when he's cooking something because Bucky always forgets that he needs to put a little salt in with the hot water and noodles and that he needs to stir it or else the noodles won't be all loose and they'll be stuck together and who the fuck eats spaghetti like that- you get the point. He also sometimes tries to be as nice to people as Steve is but it just doesn't work out because people are annoying and retarded and blind as hell because they can't seem to see that they're ugly as fuck and Steve doesn't deserve ugly. Steve doesn't need any new friends because Steve has him. But sadly, Steve has other friends. He just doesn't see them a lot as cause everybody wants to be private and not tell Steve anything that's going on with their lives. Bastards.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Maintain your teddy bear's hygiene. Groom it with a brush or a comb to detangle its fur. Keep it clean by giving it to your parents to wash once in a while. By making sure that its stays pristine, you can avoid trips to the washer.

-------------------------------------------------

"ughhh, Bucky you got fur everywhere..." Bucky didn't seem to care as he kept rolling around on the floor and Steve's feet. He rubbed his head against Steve's knees as a sign that he wanted to play.

"No, I'm not going to play fetch with you right now. I have to clean up all your fur." Bucky didn't like that Steve wouldn't play with him so he got on his hind legs and growled at Steve. Steve lifted his head to look Bucky in the eye
