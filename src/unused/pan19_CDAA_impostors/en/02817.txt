Dr. Banner are in a relationship?"

"Yes.  Now before you get all judgmental, remember we're not in the fort-" I started defensively.

"I have no problem with you two being together because of that," he interrupted.

"Then what is your problem?" I snapped.  I know I shouldn't have been so defensive, but what can I say, the guy gets to me. 

"It's not a problem, so much as a warning."

"A warning?" I asked with a raised eyebrow.

"Dr. Banner is a good man.  He looks out for others, and puts their needs in front of his own all the time.  He deserves to be treated with respect, and if you should ever fail to give him the respect he deserves, well, we'll be going a few rounds," he said seriously.

"Noted," I replied simply.  Add one more to team Bruce, I smiled in the back of my mind.  Sure, I'd just been threatened for the second time in as many days, but they were doing it for Bruce, so I couldn't be happier.

A couple weeks later, Thor returned from Asgard.  He quickly made himself at home, leaving his cape and Mjolnir in his apartment, and then making his way up to the kitchen to toast a dozen Pop-Tarts.   

"My friends, I have missed you," he said around a mouthful of Pop-Tart.  "How have you been in my absence?"

"Pretty good," I said simply.

"Yeah.  The world hasn't needed saving, and Tony and Bruce started sleeping together," Clint commented before he was slapped on the back of the head by Natasha.

"Ah, the two of you finally acknowledged your bond.  It was quite evident from the moment you greeted one another on the Flying Fortress," he boomed.

A scarlet-red Bruce slipped out of the door and down into the lab while the rest of us continued to chat.

I waited long enough to feel like I had fulfilled my duties as host, and then tried to slip out to follow Bruce into the lab, but Thor caught me by the arm.

"I would like a word with you son of Stark," he said in what for him was a quiet voice, though it was easily audible across the entire common area.

"Okay."

"I am pleased that you and Dr. Banner have acknowledged your bond, but there are times I wonder about your seriousness.  You seem to take most things lightly, and I hope that this is not one of those things," he said gravely.

"I don't," I assured.

"I am glad to hear, because you have found a most rare and wonderful match.  A great warrior who is also a healer.  One who is capable of aggression and destruction when it is necessary, but is a kind and gentle soul when it is not.  Such a person is not easy to find, and should be treated with the reverence that such a unique and wonderful being deserves."

"I do.  Bruce is the most amazing man I've every met, and I try to remind him everyday," I countered seriously.  Somehow the admonishments from the muscled god seemed to deserve a sincere answer.

"Very good.  I would just like to warn you that if you should ever forgot, I have been told by my Lady Jane that metal is a good conductor for lightning, man of Iron," he said as he rested a hand on my shoulder heavily.

"I'll keep it in mind," I answered.

Thor laughed and slapped me on the back, seemingly pleased with the answer.  He was about to walk out of the room when I had an idea.

"Thor, speaking of Dr. Foster, I was wondering if the two of you would like to go on a double date with me and Bruce.  See, on Midgard we have this practice where two couples who are friends go on a date as a group to celebrate their relationships.  They go out to dinner together, and sometimes even a movie or a walk in the park afterwards.  What do you think?  You two free tomorrow night?" 

"I think this practice of celebrating couples sounds most excellent.  I will ask My Lady Jane to prepare herself for the feast of double dating."

"Great!"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"A double date with Thor and Dr. Foster?!?" Bruce cried in exasperation.

"Yes," I confirmed.  Really, I'm not sure what the big deal was.  I mean, I know Bruce doesn't like to go out much, but as far as double dates go, they were one of the better couples we knew.

"What were you thinking?" he questioned as he ran his hands through his curls.  

"I was thinking that it would be fun.  Plus, of the couples we know, they would be the best choice, unless you'd rather go out with the super secret spy and assassin duo," I said, a little annoyed by Bruce's clear distaste for the idea. "
