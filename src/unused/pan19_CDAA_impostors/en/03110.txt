rush of bubbles against the side of face. That’s enough to make him realise that their mouths are pressed together.

So he breaks away.

His head is throbbing.

He’s kicking off the floor. He’s swimming upwards.

His mind is a mess.

The water is scalding. It’s punishing.

Haru clambers out of the pool clumsily.

There’s a sharp ringing in his ears. An ugly feeling of dread in his bones.

And then he’s running.

The floor is slippery and there is a ‘no running’ sign on the wall.

But Haru is running.

Makoto resurfaces just a moment later, a moment too late, because by the time he’s snapped back to reality Haru is almost out of sight.

“Haru!”

Haru does not stop.

“Haru, wait!”

Haru does not wait.

Haru is running.

He’s running away.

Also just a heads up, not sure when I can get the next chapter done bc I have assignments due this week (haha shoot me) but it shouldn't take too long!! Might not be tomorrow just so you know ^^

Haru thinks and thinks and thinks.Also, the pool is the best place to go when your head is a mess.

(I'M SORRY FOR MAKING YOU GUYS WAIT FOR A BIT! BUT I'M BACK!)

So firstly, I just want to say that even though all this was in my planning and it was all supposed to happen, I never realised that writing this chapter of the aftermath of that kiss was going to be THIS HARD. So it took me quite awhile, I planned it out three different times and I did not stick to any of my plans goodness gracious (me @ me whAT ARE YOu DOING) but okay, I tried, I've proofread and changed and deleted and added so many things so many times and right now I'm a little confused myself...this is by far the longest chapter, but it had to be done so I'm sorry, I do hope you enjoy it ^^Secondly, HUGE SHOUTOUT TO always_drarry FOR REMINDING ME ABOUT THE JEALOUSY PART goodness gracious I totally forgot, I am so sorry. And because I failed to add it into my planning there isn't a huge part on the jealousy, I'm really sorry. I did try to add it into this chapter, but it's kinda short and it's like a flashback. But if you guys want it please tell me bc I can add it into the last chapter!

***ALSO, BEFORE YOU READ ON!! There's something that I'll be writing in the end notes that I'd like you guys to read. Please do!! Hehe sorry for keeping you PLEASE ENJOY!


            (See the end of the chapter for  more notes.)
            

Haru closes his eyes and tries to sleep.


I don’t love him.



But you do.



But I don’t.



You do.



I don’t.



Then why did you kiss him?

To: Makoto



I’m sorry.


 

Haru stares at those same two words for the twelfth time. He sighs, hovers over the backspace button, but chooses to save it as a draft instead.

He now has twelve drafts in his phone.

All with the same two words.

I’m sorry.

Haru rolls over and pulls the blanket over his head. It’s hot, he’s sweating a little, but it does nothing to warm the cold dread in his chest.

He has not had a decent sleep in days.

When he closes his eyes, all he sees is Makoto’s face right before the kiss. Like a picture saved in his brain.

A beautiful picture.

But a picture that gives him nightmares.

And Haru cannot delete it.

He tries to ignore it. He really does. He presses the pillow over his head, as if that would stop his mind from being so cruel.

It does not stop being cruel. It continues its ploy. Because by the time Haru manages to drift off into a light slumber it whips out that image again.

Like an annoying pop-
