Tsunayoshi, The Demon Slayer?
 

Sawada Tsunayoshi was led by Reborna, her Spartan trainer, out of the dark room and the antechamber, and into the Room of Ceremony, where she was greeted by applause upon emerging. 

Blushing beet red, Tsunayoshi stumbled to a stop as she stared wide-eyed at all the people there. Reborna ignored the people (which included all his fellow trainers) and pushed Tsunayoshi towards an old man who smiled gently at her.

Tsunayoshi gasped silently as she recognized the person. Immediately, she fell upon one of her knees and kissed the ring on his finger as soon as she reached him. 

Swallowing her anxiety, Tsunayoshi managed to squeak out as she rose to her feet, “It’s… an honour to… meet you, Headmaster Vongola, sir.” 

Headmaster Timoteo Vongola laughed softly at her, “You don’t have to be nervous, my dear child. I have been waiting for a long time to meet you in person. Come to my office. We have much to discuss.” 

Before Tsunayoshi could do or say anything, the headmaster left with his bodyguard (which Tsunayoshi had failed to detect) in tow. 

“Dame-Tsuna, stop gaping like a fish and follow the Ninth. And no buts. Or have you suddenly grow a backbone and decided to defy me? Hmm?” questioned Reborna with a dark aura surrounding her. 

Tsunayoshi frantically shook her head ‘no’ and started looking around searching for someone. When she failed to find the person, she sighed in disappointment before following the path of the ninth headmaster of the Academy of Religious Order. 

Little did Tsunayoshi know that the person she was searching for was actually in her blind corner and started to follow her when she moved to do as her trainer said. The aforementioned trainer, however, had already noticed and was smirking to herself evilly.

Hibari Kyouko frowned lightly as she watched Tsunayoshi being herded towards the headmaster by the carnivore as soon as she had passed the graduation ceremony (why do they called it a graduation ceremony when it is obviously a life and death trial, Kyouko had no idea).

Her sharp, gray eyes narrowed in thought. After all, it was very suspicious that the headmaster showed up for Tsunayoshi’s graduation ceremony when he never showed for others (Kyouko would know since she had attended the ceremony for everyone as the head of the Disciplinary Committee despite her dislike for crowds). 

Looking around cautiously, the skylark waited for her guardian (which also happened to be her aunt) to get distracted by the other carnivores (Colonnello and Lal Mirch were always fighting whenever they were in the same area. Fon was the only Arcobaleno that could stop them from wanton destruction.), before slipping away in the chaos. 

Kyouko caught the smirk on Reborna’s face as she followed behind her herbivore discretely (Kyouko could be discrete when she wanted to. But, most of the time, she chose not to.), and realize that the carnivore had expected her to stalk (it’s perfectly alright for carnivores to stalk their prey.) Tsunayoshi. 

‘Things are starting to get even more interesting around here,’ Kyouko thought in amusement, despite the passive look on her face.

haha. The greeting style is so mafia-like. Please look forward to the next chapter where some secrets will be revealed.

 

Completed date: 02/09/2012

Tsunayoshi had survived her graduating ceremony. Secrets are revealed.

Disclaimer: I do not own any characters of Katekyo Hitman Reborn

Most of Tsunayoshi and co.'s abilities and weapons/equipments will be canon, but they might be called by a different name. All box animals' names will remain the same.
