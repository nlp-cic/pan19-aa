father-son relationship they build.

“Okay, dad you don’t need to say it with such a tone. I’ll explain.”

Since the summer when Erica and Boyd disappeared, Derek and Stiles became friends. Sort of. And because Kira was spending time at Scott’s, and Melissa was staying at his house, Stiles usually ended at Derek’s. The time spending together didn’t help with Stiles’ crush on Derek. Not really. 

They were pack. Touches were always a thing. After maybe three months of spending time after school with Derek, the touches were maybe a little less friendly-oriented. Or at least that was Stiles was hopping. They cuddled for a movie one time, that wasn’t totally platonic!

Derek could felt the sarcastic air quote marks on that phrase. 

“I’m almost eighteen, dad. Don’t interrupt my story. “

“Derek is almost twenty-four too!” Scott laughed at Erica’s contribution from behind. Derek blushed. Stiles looked at her wishing his look could kill her. Besides, were Erica and Boyd there from the beginning? 

“Okay, Stiles, go on. Quickly.”

Derek found out about what was happening with Stiles the first time he spent the night with him after one training with Deaton. Stiles woke up screaming and Derek saw him crying on the guest room’s floor. He held him and they moved to Derek’s room. They didn’t talk about it. Not that night not the next day, not even two weeks later.

“Sir, we didn’t do anything of what you are thinking. And that was just a few times, when you had a night shift and Scott had a date.” Derek was being too polite for Stiles’ taste. But he had to win his father and that was the only way.

Scott looked ashamed. The Sheriff ran a hand over his face and made a gesture. Stiles went on with the story.

After tons of books, Deaton’s resources and some old friends of the Hales, courtesy of Derek’s contacts, they figured out what time of magic Stiles had. He was capable of simple spells. His specialty however, was the elements. Water, fire, air, earth. He could do things with other magics elements like the mountain ash. That was something he knew he could do it, even if was a one time thing. 

The problem was, Stiles didn’t find a way to access his power. Deaton recommended choice an anchor. He was afraid that one day Stiles blow up all the contained magic. An anchor would be the only thing to calm him down.  

A month in training and Stiles decided Derek will be his anchor. Maybe that way his non-relationship moved to something else than hugs in private. They still didn’t talk about what they were doing. Stiles gave Derek time. He was a horny teenager but he understood that maybe Derek needed a slow peace, giving his history with relationships. Or maybe all was in his, again horny, mind. 

That was a non-spoken agreement. They both knew what they weren’t talking about. Derek was more than fine with that. Stiles was a minor yet. Stiles was not so much fine with that but he managed. 

Two weeks. Two weeks was all he lasted. The Sheriff had date (finally, an official date with Melissa). That was the moment when his powers decided to show up.

“Kind of. Yeah. That happened. Spontaneous combustion. It was…. hot in the room”  

Derek couldn’t contain a smirk. 

“Oh God, contain yourself. The smell is suffocating!” Scott was covering his nose. 

Erica exploded in laughter. Boyd was drinking a coffee (when he had time to made a coffee?)  The Sheriff had a horror expression on his face. Derek had the decency of turning bright red. Stiles groaned. 

“Can I finish this so we can go all to sleep?”

“I can’t take it anymore”  

Stiles put some distance and looked at him at the eyes. “What are you talking about?” 

“This. You. Your…hormones and feelings all over me” 

“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it. I can’t control it. You don’t need to be all uncomfortable around me, I get it. We can be friends like we were before, right? Or my stupid feelings ruined everything?”  

Derek smiled. His smile grew bigger at Stiles’ confusion. 

“How can you be so smart but so oblivious at the same time?” 

Stiles didn’t have time to answer. Someone was kissing him. By someone he meant Derek. Derek was kissing him. Derek was kissing him 

In a matter of seconds things got hotter. Stiles was lying on the couch, Derek on top of him. He didn’t ever realize when Derek's shirt went off. 

“God, you feel so hot” Stiles said while Derek left a pat of kisses on his
