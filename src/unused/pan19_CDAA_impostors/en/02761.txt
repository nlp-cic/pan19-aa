I do that I’ve got a few years before Dad retires, and that’s plenty of time to decide.

                I… well… it’s stupid…

                It’s just that…

                I really want to enroll in a dancing school, but I don’t think CEO’s have much time for that.

                Besides, Dad wouldn’t approve.

                It’s getting late, and I have a lot of designing to finish. Fortunately, the Cabbage Corp radio program is ending in a few minutes and I’ll get to catch the latest Fire Ferrets match. Apparently they’ve got some new hotshot celebrity on their team; I’ll have to listen closely and find out who it is. Goodnight Mom, I’ll write you again in a few days.

                I love you so much,

                Dear Mom,

 

                It was the Avatar— the Avatar is on a Probending team! I never thought I’d see the day, but I guess anything’s possible in Republic City. Apparently her name is Korra, and she can’t follow the official rules worth a damn! I’m thinking about going down to the Arena to catch one of their matches and see her in action for myself; you know what they say— most people don’t even get a glimpse of the Avatar in their lifetimes, let alone witness them bending!

                Maybe I’ll invite Dad along?

                I’ve been looking in the paper for advertisements… or articles… or at least something about local humane society shelters— I was kind of thinking a dog might be nice, or maybe I could adopt something smaller; like a Fire Ferret! Do you think that Flying Lemurs would leave the Air Temples? I’ve been reading some of Avatar Aang’s autobiography, and they seem like wonderful companions. I suppose that wouldn’t be right, would it? Like… a cultural appropriation of sorts. But that’s okay, there are plenty of other animals to look at.

                The radio’s just… the program stopped…

                Mom, it’s that man again— Amon. He’s talking about the “Bending Tyranny”, and he wants Nonbenders to join his Equalist Revolution. I feel a little scared, but if what he says is true, then why would I feel this way about him?

                I don’t trust him one bit.

                Well, at least the radio cut back to the music, but judging by the stiffness of the workers around me, I don’t think anyone’s going to be relaxed by a little bit of melody. Some of them are smiling, and it’s putting me on edge— I suppose some people want the Benders to loosen up their grip on the city, but that doesn’t make what the Equalists do any more righteous.

                I’ve called everyone off for the day; told them to go home and relax an hour early. I suppose that means I’ll have to stop this letter and actually be responsible.

                Loving you with all my heart,

 

                Asami

                Dear Mom,

 

                I don’t know how to say this elegantly; I ran over a cute boy with my moped today. Don’t worry! He wasn’t hurt, just a little shaken up. Mom… I ran over Mako— from the Fire Ferrets! I couldn’t believe it when I recognized him, but I’ve met the Captain of my favorite Probending team! You’re not going to believe this— I’m going on a date with him!

                Going to Kwongs requires one of my better dresses, don’t you think? Let’s see… I’ve got one with a low neckline, but is that a little forward?

                Perhaps I’m getting a little too excited, the date isn’t for another two days after all… but I can’t help but feel absolutely giddy about this— I haven’t dated anyone since Tomoko (don’t tell Dad about her), and it’ll be nice to get back in the scene. Still, despite the overexcitement, I want to wear an impressive dress; I have a great feeling about this one, Mom.

                Oh!

                I forgot to tell you; Dad’s put me on a prototyping team for testing human reactions to small amounts of electricity— says he’s thinking about going into defibrillators, which would be wonderful because the Cabbage Corp brand have… well… put down more people than they’ve saved. He wants me to look into something handheld that doesn’t require a large power source, suggested a glove? I wish I had more information, but Dad seemed eager to have my input on the design.

                I’ve decided on adopting a cat, but I’m going to make sure I have a place for it— wouldn’t want it running around your prized couches and chairs, or leaving scat all over dad’s newest blueprints. Still, it’ll be nice to have a companion, and a quiet one at that. Maybe I’ll
