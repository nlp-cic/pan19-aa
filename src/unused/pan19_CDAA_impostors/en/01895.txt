 Nino snickered to himself. At that moment, a notification appeared on the computer by the desk that an order had been made for one large pizza, with mushrooms, olives, and green peppers. 


 



[NinoBambino:14:26] hey it looks like i got just what I wished for, i guess someone really did want to order a pizza at 2 lol

 A blush appeared on Nino’s face. A heart? ‘Was that… whatdoesthatmeanomfg’. The poor boy had no idea how to respond, so he just dropped his phone and bolted to an unsuspecting Adrien.


 


 “ADRIEEEEEEEEEEEN!!!!” Nino yelled.


 


 “aAH MY GOD!!! BRO WHAT DO YOU WANT?!” Adrien screamed, as he fell out of his chair.


 


 “I’M SO SORRY MAN THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT YOU NEED TO GO DO AN ORDER ASAP PLEASE” He shoved the address written on a piece of paper quickly into Adrien’s face. Nino’s cheeks got increasingly redder as he remembered why he was so adamant on having Adrien take the order… and Adrien soon caught on.


 


 “Oh… I see casanova. Alya?” Adrien smirked. Nino blushed harder as he played with his headphones. “Gosh you are so in love it hurts, but I understand bro. I guess physics will have to wait this time. Good luck man~” Adrien winked. Nino shot him a grateful look, and Adrien went to get the pizza ready, nice and slow. After seeing the address, Adrien knew there was no way he’d make it in under 30 minutes, so he figured making a good pizza would make this customer pretty happy.



~~~~~~


 


 “Well there’s the 30 minute mark. I guess we’re getting a free pizza Tikki~” Marinette said happily. She thanked her lucky stars she lived so far away from Pizza Hut, she wouldn’t have been able to pay rent if she had gotten charged for her dinner. A few minutes later, a knock was heard at her door. Marinette got up and answered.


 


 “You ordered a pizza?” Adrien asked. He looked over the girl answering the door. “Wait a sec… Marinette?”


 


 “O-oh hey Adrien!” Marinette blushed. She hadn’t seen him since high school, and observing him further he had probably gotten even more attractive over the course of one year- at least to her. Adrien had definitely gotten taller, and he had developed a little more of a build.


 


 “I haven’t seen you in a while, how’ve you been?” Adrien asked. Adrien similarly, observed how much Marinette had changed as well… however she hadn’t changed in a particularly good way. She was already quite thin before, however now he could practically see the bones in her hands, and her face had looked much more… tired than he remembered. Her hair got a bit longer, and was left down instead of in two pigtails. She wore a shabby t-shirt and sweatpants instead of her usual fashionable garb, which surprised him greatly. Even if she was wearing pajamas, a year ago she would’ve worn some patterned matching pants and shirt, so what changed?


 


 “Oh um… I guess ok more or less.” Her face fell. “School’s been really taking a toll on me haha, so.” Adrien noticed her eyes weren't as bright as they used to be, and upon further inspection he saw dark circles under her them.


 


 “Oh I see… I know the feeling, my dad raised the stakes on my modeling jobs. Now that I’m in uni he expects a lot more from me… But uh is it ok if I come in? If there are any other orders Nino can probably handle them himself, and I…
