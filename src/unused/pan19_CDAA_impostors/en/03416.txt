trying to get me to spill the fucking beans and if I wasn’t so mentally fucked right now I might be able to think of a coherent reply but –

“No way out of it now asshole. So who is it?” He leans down as he says it, and I’d be lying if I said I was trying not to suppress shiver at the tone he’s adopted. That and the fact that I am trying to work every mental trick in the book to not spring a hard-on at the moment, “Historia? Oh wait, I bet it’s that girl that’s always ridiculously serious.  What’s her name? Ashely? Adry? Oh right, Annie.”

I can’t even say anything, it’s like the sudden closeness in proximity has wiped my memory clear of the English language. And damn, that cocky smirk of his is doing a magical job at burning a hole right through me and sending that fire straight to my groin. There’s something in his eyes I can’t quite place, I’ve never seen it before and I’d have to say it’s rather unnerving being under such intense scrutiny.

Before I can choke out a reply the harsh sound of a phone vibrating pierces the tense silence. We both look to the source of the noise. My phone is on the nightstand next to my bed, glowing and buzzing obnoxiously like a welcome beckon of hope for my dignity. I scramble to pick up the offending device, successfully startling Levi enough to relinquish his hold on me. I don’t even check the caller ID before answering with an extremely winded ‘hello’.

“Eren? Are you okay?” It’s Mikasa. Shit, I’ve never been so thankful for the woman in my life.

“Yeah Mikasa, I’m fine. What’s up?” I can feel Levi sink back into the bed even though I refuse to look at him.

“I just wanted to ask if there was anything you needed at the store. I’m here now and I realized I forgot to ask before I left.” I can hear the faint bustling of shoppers behind her voice and choose to focus on that instead of the rustling behind me. Suddenly I feel hands combing through the ends of my hair and my breath involuntarily hitches.

“Eren? Are you sure you’re okay?”

“Uh, yeah. I’m fine don’t worry about it. If you could get some shampoo that’d be great.” Trying to make conversation. It’s not really working.

“Alright. I’ll see you when I get back. Don’t destroy the house.”

“No promises.” With the way things have been going, that isn’t too far from the truth. She scoffs and we say our goodbyes and I’m engulfed in silence yet again. Levi’s still fingering with my hair, his slender fingers massaging my scalp. I do like it, I’m just uncomfortable in my own skin again.

“You don’t have to tell me. I completely understand if you prefer to keep it between you and whoever it is.” Fuuuck why do you have to sound to dejected? I didn’t kill your goldfish. I didn’t lose your homework. God dammit I have it bad. So fucking bad.

“Thank you Levi, for understanding.” I sigh. The thing is, he doesn’t understand. Not even the slightest bit.

We spend the rest of the night watching Netflix.

We don’t speak.

In all honesty, things were kind of weird between me and Levi after the whole ‘almost told you I have a crush on you’ disaster. Maybe it was just weird for me. It probably was. After all, I am a dipshit. But I think I’m a pretty perceptive dipshit. Levi and I still hung out like always, but there was always certain air of tension whenever it was just the two of us. I felt (feel) like I’m waiting for something to snap.

Any time now.

It’s finally the time of year I know Levi hates the most. Christmas. While everyone thinks that having a birthday on such a massive holiday is super cool, Ebenezer Scrooge over here practically hides in his room all day to escape the inevitable celebration. I completely understand though. It is his birthday, but in a way it kind of gets swept under the rug in the chaos of gift-wrapping and cooking.

Mikasa, Armin, and I invited him over to our place to allow him refuge from his obnoxious extended family. They were horribly reluctant to let him go, even going so far as to tell us no, but Levi doesn’t give two shits about what they think. He called me at seven twenty-one, the sun already descending over the horizon, on Christmas Eve with a rather odd request.

“Hey dude, what’s up?”

“Can you come over to my place?” He whispered.

“Yeah sure.
