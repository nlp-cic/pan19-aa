only he could be saved from this fate, but there was only one person who could do that, and he was probably enjoying himself with his new boyfriend.

No he would have to go on.  Homeless.  Loveless.  And for the moment, pantless.


Each night I cry.  I still believe the lie, "I love you 'till I die."


Finally done with his daily series of hulk-outs, a routine he had been following for the last few days, he built a shelter and a fire.  Like the nights before, he cried as he settled next to the warm glow and stared up at the night sky. 

"I love you, Tony," he whispered before drifting off to sleep.

 I don't want my freedom.  There's no reason for living with a broken heart.


Back in New York, Tony was sitting at the bar drowning himself in whiskey and trying to figure out how things had gone so wrong.

The lyrics of the song from the playlist he had asked JARVIS to play struck him.  Bruce had said he was giving Tony "the freedom to be with whomever he wanted" by leaving, but that made no sense.  He didn't want anyone else.  He wanted Bruce, and only Bruce.

He couldn't see how he was supposed to be free now.  All he felt was broken.  Broken beyond repair or hope.  So broken that the words of the song made perfect sense.


 This is a tricky situation.  I've only got myself to blame.  It's just a simple fact of life . . .it can happen to anyone.


What was worse was he knew it was all his fault.  He hadn't stopped Steve from kissing him.  He hadn't wanted him to do it, but he hadn't stopped it either.  He'd let it go on far too long, and Bruce saw.  There really was no explaining that away.  No matter how much he wanted to.


You win, you lose.  It's a chance you have to take with love.  Oh yeah, I fell in love, but now you say it's over and I'm falling apart.


Nothing in love was certain except that if you didn't open yourself up it would never work.  

He opened his heart to Bruce, and the after a stupid momentary lapse of judgment on Tony's part, Bruce had run out looking angry and hurt.  So hurt that the memory of the pain in his eyes made Tony hate himself a little bit more.

He'd followed, but Bruce had told him to stay away.  He said it was over, and Tony was free to be with whomever he wanted.  

Tony wanted to beg him to stay.  To tell him it was a mistake and he had no interest in anyone else, but the look of sheer betrayal in Bruce's eyes had rendered him mute.  He's turned around sadly and made his way to the bar in the penthouse, and that's where he'd stayed for the past three days, trying to drink away the guilt and pain.


It's a hard life, to be two lovers together, to love and live together in each other's arms


All he wanted was to have his Bruce back.  To hold him close, and whisper how much he loved him, but that seemed impossible now.  Life had different plans it seemed.


It's a long hard fight.  To learn to care for each other.  To trust in one another right from the start.  When you're in love.


He would fight, but he felt like their trust was gone.  That fragile thing that had developed so quickly and effortlessly between them when they met.

It was funny.  The trust that they had between them had given them a fighting chance despite all of the obstacles that should have been between them.  Neither of them were exactly baggage-free.  But daddy issues, guilt complexes, arc reactors and rage monsters aside they had a trust that had bridged those gaps.  Now it appeared a few careless moments had taken that trust and shattered it, leaving what felt like irreparable damage.


I try and mend the broken pieces.  I try to fight back the tears.


Then again, maybe everything wasn't as broken as he thought . . . Maybe he could "mend the broken pieces."

He pulled out his phone and dialed Bruce's number.  Maybe if he could just explain, maybe, just maybe, it could be fixed.

He heard a phone ringing in the bedroom and knew better than to hope.  Bruce had left his phone behind.  He didn't want to be found, and he didn't want to work things out.  It was well and truly over between them.

The thought overwhelmed him so much he lost himself in watching his tears plummet into his tumbler, and forgot all about the song that seemed to describe his heartache all too well.  Perhaps it was for the best.  It was hardly making him feel better.

He was about to tell JARVIS to turn it off as the chorus
