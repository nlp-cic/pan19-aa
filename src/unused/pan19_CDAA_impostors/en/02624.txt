shop we went before.”

“That shop?! But Shi—“

“Return here by 15 minutes.”

“You do fucking know that it takes at least 30—“

“Get out!” He finally raises his voice. That is a first time too.

“FINE!” And I storms out his house.

What the hell.

And now, I’m using his bike. Shit, I’m too weak for Shin-chan.

Well, it’s my fault after all. I will replace it by today, okay. But 15 minutes is just impossible.

Just impossible!

I don’t care if he gets angry! He should at least understand that the shop is very far!

And by this time, I really wonder if they’re still open?


Return here by 15 minutes


Shit, he said that with a threatening voice.

He was really angry huh…

Then, with the bad timing I just had to recall enjoying my time with Shin-chan. To end that with such an silly fight…haaa.

Reflexively, I pedal faster. And faster. And faster.

Ah! Whatever! You win, Shin-chan!

 


II.


That’s the shop! Nice, the lights are still on!

And yes! It’s still open!

I hastily park the bicycle anywhere in the road, jumped out of it and run in front of the store.

“Oh, Kazunari! It’s already late!” The lady owner of the store, Shizu-chan, remarks. She already remembers my face and name because lately, I’m the one buying the lucky items for Shin-chan here.

“Ah, Shizu-chan! Do you still have the green glass frog! I need it now!” I tell her.

“Lucky! I only have one left, tell that to Shintarou. Here, 300 yen only~”

“Oh, That cheap?! This morning, wasn’t it 3000 yen? Nice.”

“Well, you’re a cutie. And this is the last piece, so I’m practically giving it.”

“Thanks! I really need to hurry back! Shin-chan’s fuming with anger!” I bid farewell as I run back to the bicycle, with the figure protected with a thick box.

“Hey, when will you going out with me, Kazunari?” she asks, before I’m able to start pedaling.

“Sorry, Shizu-chan, already have someone I like.”

“Oh? Do I know this person, then?”

“Haha, I’m leaving it to your imagination! Ja!” And I start the bicycle.

Faster and faster and faster.

It is a nice breeze as the wind meets my skin. Night bicycling is really fun! The roads are almost empty, except the main road.

Next time, maybe I will be able to invite Shin-chan!

I look at my clock.

“Shoot! Only 3 minutes left! I got to hurry!”

And I pedaled faster.

And faster.

 


IV.


“Kise? Why are you calling this late?” I ask, rather annoyed. It is already 1 am, and Takao still not back. What the hell is taking him long?

Or he might have gone home.

Well, I kicked him out of house after all. And he’s not so nice to buy me the lucky item this late. He will probably just apologize tomorrow.

“Kise?” He is not answering, but rather talking to other people in the background.


Will he be okay? Hey!



Don’t push around, the patient’s condition is critical!



Wow…the bike’s really deformed.



He’s probably running it full speed. How stupid.



What was that? An accident?


There were multiple voices, and a siren.

“Midorimacchi! It’s Takaocchi! He’s…I’m on my way to Seirin Hos—“

The line became very choppy, before it is completely cut off.

Either Kise’s phone battery is drained, or he cannot call anymore.

I don’t care.

What about Takao? Why the hospital…?


He’s…running it full speed… the bike…deformed….


Don’t tell me…!

Just no.

No.

No.

Just really no.

My feet just started running towards the hospital.

 


VI.


Before it was painful, very painful. I thought my body was being crushed into pieces. I cannot recall what happened, but I can still remember how my whole body hurt at that time.

And before I fell asleep or whatever, everything had become just dark.

From the corner of my consciousness, I heard the siren and whispers of people.

There was a familiar voice… is it Kise Ryouta from Kaijo?

Shit…I’m still sleepy.

And I feel something prickling my skin at that time.

And now somebody is holding my hand?

Shit…I want to sleep.

Sh…

Did I fall asleep? Right now, my whole body feels so refreshed. What was I doing before this?

I open my eyes. It was very white.
