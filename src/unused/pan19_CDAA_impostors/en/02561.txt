Here’s some water, mum.”

“Oh, thank you Polly. Really, such a fuss. No, we must tend to William. This night is very important. We must find him a wife, soon.”

“Mistress, you needn’t worry so. The staff will always look after Master William, even after…” her voice trailed off.

“Oh, dearest Mabel. I know you would. But it isn’t the same. And without me to prod him into society, I fear he’d never venture out to make a match on his own. No, no, tonight will be the night. Please, help me up.” All the girls reached out to help her stand. Buffy was impressed with what a strong woman Spike’s mother was. Clearly she was ill, but the fire in her eyes demonstrated the love of her son. Buffy felt a wave of horror for her. She hoped she died never knowing what her son had become and what he had done.

Just then, she realized she had her chance. She leaped over the short stone fence into the kitchen yard. She went through the piles of laundry and grabbed some bloomers, a corset, a dress and shawl. She also grabbed a plain white shirt and pants for Spike. She had no idea if any of it would fit, but they would work that out later. She bundled them all up in a large blanket that was hanging on a line and headed back to the workshop.



************************************************************************

“Spike. Spike!” she whispered as she shook him. He’d gone back to sleep after she left and now it was like waking the dead-literally.

Suddenly his hand shot up and he grabbed her by the throat. She brought her hand up in a sweeping blow and knocked his arm away, nearly falling off the ladder she was standing on. He sat up and looked at her.

”Sorry, babe. I didn’t know it was you.”

“Like hell.” She said as she threw the clothes at him. “Get dressed. We’ve got some snoopin’ to do”

“Crap. I hated these clothes.”

“Just put them on. Hopefully they fit.”

“They should. They’re mine.” She nodded. Of course they were.

“Good,” and she backed down the ladder.

Now to figure out how to get dressed herself. The shift was easy, if thin. She felt very exposed with just a thin piece of cotton covering her. The corset was presenting a problem. She had loosened it enough to get it over her head and shoulders, but now, how was she to tighten the damn thing back up? The laces were in the back. She tried turning it around but it was so stiff and hard that it didn’t work.

“You need some help.”

She jumped a bit and covered the top of her chest. It was funny. She was more covered up than she was with most of her normal outfits, but she felt practically naked. She looked at Spike. He looked much like William had, except that his hair was bleached and muscles now strained against the fabric of his shirt. His pants also seemed to stretch over him.

“I don’t know how this works.” She offered lamely.

“That’s ‘cause it takes two people. In my day, women never dressed alone. Someone had to lace ‘em up. Turn around.” He walked up to her and began to straighten the corset around.

“You need to lift your tits into the cups or it won’t lace properly.”

“Are you insane? I tried that and they nearly fell out the top.”

Spike struggled for control. “That’s the fashion, luv. That’s the point of this whole contraption.”

“Fine.” She turned away from him as she adjusted herself.

She glanced back at him. “Ok, fix it now.”

He pulled on the cords, making them tighter. With each pull she felt herself gasping.

“What the hell are you doing?”

Spike sighed. “You really will fall out if it isn’t very snug. I don’t blame you. I could never understand how women could stand these things. There, done.”

She turned around and he was dumbstruck. To see her lovely flesh pressed over the top of her corset took his breath away. Now he remembered why corsets were such wonderful things.

“Yo, eyes up this way lech-boy.”

“What? Oh, sorry.” He took a step towards her. “No, that’s a lie. I’m not sorry. You’re beautiful.” He placed his hands on her now even narrower hips and pulled her to him.

“And you’re not going to do this again. I told you.” She leaned away but did not break his grasp. He eyed her hungrily and she could feel the fire of arousal starting to smolder inside her. She had to do something.

“I saw William.” She spoke directly, locking his eyes.
