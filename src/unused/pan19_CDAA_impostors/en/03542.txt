Today i met a boy.

He wore suspenders.

He had caramel coloured hair.

He smelt like clean laundry.

He smelt like autumn leaves.

Or what i assosciate autumn with.

He wore stripes.

He smiled at me.

I smiled back.

**

So am i on the road to recovery yet?

Am i better?

Have you dealt with me?

Are we done?

No?

Okay. 

But i don’t know what else to say.

I’m still lucky.

A bad thing happened.

But it’s how you react and treat the bad thing that matters.

It’s the aftermath that changes you.

Still charming Harry.

Still lucky.

**

The boy i mentioned before?

Today i learnt his name is Louis.

He smiles a lot.

He makes me smile a lot.

He said my dimples were cute.

I wanted to let him know all of him was cute.

When he complimented me…

It felt like a compliment again.

It didn’t feel sickening.

It wasn’t a reminder.

It was nice.

It used to be easy.

Smile at someone cute.

Get their number.

Call them.

Kiss them.

Simple.

Routine.

Now it’s scary.

The constant thought of what if

I was wrong once.

I made a mistake.

People often do.

But why does it feel like i’m paying for it more?

One mistake and i constantly look over my shoulder.

Sleep with the light on.

Nobody can sneak up behind me anymore.

If somebody grabs me, even as a joke, i jump.

You can’t speak too loudly.

You can’t speak too quietly.

Is that still lucky?

Or careful?

**

Louis told me he wanted to take me out.

He said he wanted to see me smile more.

I asked him why he had to come here too.

He showed me his arm.

Cut after cut after cut.

He’s so beautiful.

They’re such ugly scars.

He has to live with a physical, visible reminder of who he was.

What he went through.

He has war wounds.

Am i jealous?

I sound it don’t i.

Because he has proof.

People will believe him.

Who would believe me?

A flirty, helper at the local baker who sings part time?

It’d ridiculous to my own ears.

I told Louis i’d think about it.

He told me he wouldn’t give up.

He hadn’t given up before, on himself.

He wouldn’t give up now, on me.**

Gemma was the one that noticed

She saw me slowly slip away

Become someone else

She watched me flinch.

She knew something was wrong.

I remember she hugged me so tightly.

So securely.

And she just cried.

She begged to know what was wrong.

I remember she said,

It’s like you’re dead.

A living dead person.

I looked at her

And I knew I just had to tell her

But I didn’t know how to.

I can’t even say it to myself, how do I say it to her?

That night her and mum argued.

Mum said I was fine.

Just being a teenage boy.

God, I wished that were true.

 **

Louis asked me out again today.

I told him no, again.

He wasn’t angry.

He just smiled at me and said,

“One day.”

 **

I remember the unimportant parts of what happened that night.

I remember it was Cher’s party.

She was drunk and giggling by the time we got there.

After it was like everything was fuzzy.

I couldn’t see anyone.

It was all a blur of colour and faces.

Noise was distant, like a buzz.

Then Niall made a joke about how my pants were undone.

He said only I would get so lucky so fast.

There’s that word again.

Lucky.

Liam noticed I was in a daze.

He asked me what was wrong.

He’s that kind of guy.

That type of friend.

I barely even heard him,

I just kept walking.

I felt sick.

I felt raw.

It was disgusting, and new.

Liam grabbed my arm and I had to push him away to throw up.

He kept asking me what was wrong.

Zayn came over to me and looked me straight into the eye.

I knew he knew.

He just looked at me.

He’s the silent type.

But he understands far too much.

A wallflower.

He told Liam to back off.

All three of them watched me walk straight out of the party,

And on I walked.

On and on.

I felt faint.

I threw up three times.

What a lucky night for Harry Styles.

 **

Today Louis wasn’t there.

Is he better now?

Where did he go?

I missed him.

I missed seeing the boy in the suspenders.

I missed seeing the boy that made me smile.

 **

I am trying you know.

My mum thinks I’m not.

That this is a waste of
