Spectrum(And Every Colour Illuminates) When we first came hereWe were cold and we were clearWith no colours in our skinWe were light and paper thinAnd when we first came herewe were cold and we were clearWith no colours in our skin'Til we let the spectrum in…And when we come for youWe'll be dressed up all in blueWith the ocean in our armsKiss your eyes and kiss your palms…Say my nameAnd every colour illuminatesWe are shiningAnd we will never be afraid again Spectrum – Florence + The Machine
